At Black Cove</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE cabin sloop <i>Water Witch</i> had cleared
Centerport harbor and was well out in the
bay heading towards the Catlow, or “Off Shore,”
Islands when the first strange incident happened
which was to start the G-man’s son, Stanley Sandborn,
and his lanky, dark-haired chum, John
Tallman, off on an adventure which was both
bizarre and dangerous. Stanley was the first to
notice the swiftly approaching gray runabout
speedboat.</p>

<p>“Look at that fellow come!” said Stanley.
“He’s doing closer to fifty than forty knots and
notice how low he is!”</p>

<p>“Sailing bluebirds, and slices of pickled onion!”
cried John Tallman, exploding into one of his
characteristic odd remarks. “You can hardly see
him for spray!”</p>

<p>“And gray is an odd color for a yacht!” commented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Stanley, pushing his mop of sandy hair
back from his eyes, the better to study the form
and speed of the racing boat which was now
sweeping across the bows of the smoothly sailing
sloop.</p>

<p>The <i>Water Witch</i> pitched and tossed in a moment
or two as the wide “V” of the speedboat’s
wake crossed the course of the sailboat. The rigging
and sails of the black-hulled boat slatted and
swayed drunkenly, then she steadied in the strong
southwest breeze sweeping up the bay and continued
her easy dip and roll through the waves of
the open bay. The speedboat sped off towards
the islands, almost silently, save for a low humming.</p>

<p>“More than one thing odd about that boat,
John!” Stan remarked. “Extra speed, gray
paint, and an underwater exhaust! If this were
prohibition times I’d say—rum-runner!”</p>

<p>“Me too. Dunk me in the briny deep and hang
me up to dry! Slide over the hamburgers, mates,
but I’ve a hunch we haven’t seen the last of that
craft!”</p>

<p>“Funny, John,” the G-man’s son said, half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
aloud, half to himself, “I’m thinking the same
thing.”</p>

<p>John Tallman shrugged his shoulders, then
laughed as cheerfully as he could.</p>

<p>“Trouble with us, Stan,” he said, “is that we’ve
seen so much of speeding boats and water fights
that we just jump to conclusions! Because we
just spent the last week or so helping capture
Dapper Dan Hogan and his gang and those
other mobsters, we’ve got detecting and suspicion
on the brain! Bluebottle flies and anthill creepers—let’s
drop the subject! Me for coffee and doughnuts!”</p>

<p>“Attaboy, John,” laughed Stan. “Stir up
some eats. We ought to be close to Porpoise Island
by sunset!”</p>

<p>John watched the last white spray of the speedboat
disappearing towards that very spot of the
barely visible humps of the Off Shore Islands,
a perplexed frown upon his lean features, then he
ducked down into the cozy cabin of the sloop to
dig up a snack of food for the famished boys, for
they had been under way for hours now and were
very hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>The trim and pretty <i>Water Witch</i> rolled along,
dipping her lee rail in white water, for she was
rather speedy and a good sailor, while Stan, at
the wheel, peered across the water towards Porpoise
Island where they planned to camp out for
the next week or so, cruising betimes among the
wooded, lonely Catlow Islands nearby. Certain
of the outlying islands on the edge of the ocean
were populous summer resorts and winter colonies
and had a regular steamer traffic, but Porpoise
Island and the close-by islets were rarely visited,
if at all, being privately owned and plastered with
“Keep-off” signs. The two boys, however, being
bent merely on a little harmless pleasure, saw no
harm in cruising among them, and perhaps pitching
a tent on one of the beaches provided they did
not trespass on the land itself.</p>

<p>They were particularly anxious to visit Black
Cove, a little known and very snug small harbor
which Mr. Sandborn, Stan’s father, had noticed
on a chart while the boys and the G-man were
poring over the marine maps of the bay and
waters around the islands a few nights ago.</p>

<p>“There,” Mr. Sandborn had remarked, “is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
something to look into. I bet I’ve studied this
chart dozens of times in the last ten years, boys,
and cruised some about the islands, and I never
happened to notice what a perfect little harbor
Black Cove should be for a small boat like yours.”</p>

<p>He had pointed to the spot on the chart and
shown the boys that the cove had a narrow but
comparatively deep channel and that the center
of the land-locked little harbor was a good twenty
feet deep and had a dark loam bottom. Because
of the dark mud and loam under the water there
the water itself would seem almost black even on
clear days, thus giving the cove its name, no
doubt. This Mr. Sandborn surmised from past
experiences with small anchorages and different
types of sea bottom.</p>

<p>“Sounds mysterious, too,” John had interrupted,
excitedly, that evening. “Rally round
the saucepan, boys; the cook’s serving soup!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn had been taking a well-earned
vacation of a few days after the capture of the
notorious gangsters, chiefly represented by Mr.
Dapper Dan Hogan, in which event the two boys
had had no small part. The <i>Water Witch</i>, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
will remember, played a big part in the adventures
attendant upon the pursuit and capture of the
criminals as did also Stan’s and John’s bow and
arrows. And during those few days the boys had
been planning the cruise to the Catlow Islands.</p>

<p>It was a cruise they had had in mind ever since
acquiring the <i>Water Witch</i> and save for the interference
and subsequent capture of Hogan and
the other gangsters, the boys would have made the
big cruise sooner. Now they were making up for
lost time. Below decks were their bows and
arrows, cameras, including the special G-man
camera Mr. Sandborn had loaned them in case—just
in case—they might have use for it; their
sleuthing paraphernalia of fingerprint powders,
brushes, and magnifying glasses; some adventure
books and boys’ magazines; lots and lots of food
(for John was a prodigious eater!); charts of the
waters they were entering for the first time; and
the hundreds of items needed to make the trip an
outstanding success. Bit by bit it had been stowed
away, a task in itself considering the rather short
length and small capacity of sloop. And in all her
brave black top sides and green underbody, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the bullet holes from the big battle at Cedar Island
all properly plugged and shipshape, the <i>Water
Witch</i> had sailed out of Centerport Harbor,
pleasure-bound.</p>

<p>The sun was dipping lower and lower as the
boat covered the last long mile across the bay in
the dying breeze. The aroma of delicious hot
coffee came drifting back from the galley and
John could be heard mumbling and humming an
off-key tune. But for snitches of doughnuts as
he was preparing the meal, the cook would have
been able to sing right out!</p>

<p>At last came the welcome news to the helmsman
that dinner, or supper, was ready.</p>

<p>“Call it anything you like, but serve it, Cookie!”
Stan rejoined. “I’m about ready to gnaw a chunk
out of this wheel!”</p>

<p>“Here you are! Why not lash the wheel, Skipper,
and come below for eats?” queried John.</p>

<p>“O.k., be right down!”</p>

<p>With that Stan slipped a bit of roping over the
spokes of the wheel and, jockeying the craft a
bit to get the right pressure of the rudder, tightened
a hitch about a cleat. He had already done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the same with the main sheet and the keen little
vessel now sailed along by herself on a fairly good
course in what was left of the evening breeze while
the Captain joined his cook below decks at a meal
that was filling and appetizing. Rolls and butter,
some canned beef with sauces, plenty of jam, a
slice or two of cake, a few doughnuts, coffee, and
a liberal glass of milk were enjoyed amidst much
joking and fun. John was a “scream,” always
thinking of some funny remark and keeping the
more serious Stan in general good humor. They
were just finishing supper when the <i>Water Witch</i>
jolted hard to port, dumping the remains of the
meal into John’s lap, for he sat on that side of
the small portable table, and pitching Stan half
onto his chum!</p>

<p>“Help!” cried John. “Bluebirds and fireflies—and
bushels of grape-juice-biscuits! We’re
wrecked, Skipper!”</p>

<p>Quickly, even as the <i>Water Witch</i> righted herself
and the scraping sounds which had penetrated
the interior of the sloop disappeared, the boys
were in the cockpit staring wildly about!</p>

<p>Nothing greeted their startled eyes save the unruffled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
water of the bay, for the last of the breeze
had died with the fast setting sun and only an
occasional “cat’s-paw” disturbed the surface here
and there. The sloop heeled slowly, creaking
just a little, to one of these soft puffs of wind
now.</p>

<p>“Well, tender chunks of jellybeans—what
happened?” John wanted to know, scratching
his head and running lean fingers through the
dark hair, while his dark eyes pondered and stared.</p>

<p>“John, in the first place, we struck something
that was submerged. Might have been a water-soaked
log, or almost anything. Let’s take a
bearing and see what the chart says. Should have
five fathoms along here if my memory serves me!”</p>

<p>The chart showed six fathoms of water and
there were no indications of rocks or obstructions
of any other kind in the spot where the <i>Water
Witch</i> had struck.</p>

<p>“I took a careful bearing from the trees on top
of Porpoise Island, Stan,” John pointed out, “and
another on the Centerport Watch Hill Tower
that we can just see across the bay. The angle is
a good one and I’m sure I got it right. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
whatever we struck is a ‘foreign body’——”</p>

<p>“Maybe the upper structure of some sunken
ship, John!” Stan interrupted.</p>

<p>“Upper structure or keel, I don’t know, Stan,
but—I do know that the last of my coffee soaked
my pants!”</p>

<p>John went below to change into something dry
and while he was there he quietly inspected the
forepeak of the craft where the anchor cable was
stored, and the spare sails and lines, and then
peered under the cabin floor boards but found no
signs of extra water. Evidently the ship had not
been damaged by contact with whatever the object
had been. In dry attire, John went back on deck
and relieved his friend at the wheel.</p>

<p>Stan now went below and studied the charts
for some minutes, coming back on deck after a
short time and indicating the eastern tip of Porpoise
Island. The long low island bore a faint resemblance,
when seen from a distance, to the back
of a sporting porpoise, hence its name, and the
eastern tip was the “snout.”</p>

<p>“Keep clear of the snout there, John, by at least
a hundred yards, because of low water and rocks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
now that we’re getting in close, and put her on the
other tack after we round the point.”</p>

<p>“Righto, Skipper. Blow me down, my
hearties, and smack the main brace!”</p>

<p>Both boys peered curiously at the bushes and
clusters of cedar trees and the few oaks covering
the slopes of the island as the boat sailed slowly,
half-drifting, past the snout and they were able to
see the seaward or southern side of the island.
Black Cove should be about a half mile down that
side and the angle of entrance was so sharp that
the boys actually sailed past without spotting the
opening! It was Stan who first detected their
mistake.</p>

<p>“John, we’ve gone past the entrance to Black
Cove, I’m sure. It’s getting so dark I can hardly
see a thing, anyhow and we’ve sure missed it!”</p>

<p>It was indeed getting dark in spite of the lingering
twilight and the <i>Water Witch</i> swung about
and back, feeling the strength of a brisk night
breeze now springing up. The breeze might last
an hour or less and they must make the cove before
it died again. Intent, anxious, Stan stood by the
mast of the boat, peering sharply ahead as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
heeling sloop closed in with the island, risking
danger among the scattered rocks, to find the
clear, deep entrance to the harbor.</p>

<p>Suddenly Stan cried out and pointed!</p>

<p>A bright light had flickered for an instant or
two somewhere on the island and the way in which
it had disappeared caused Stan to say, “That
light was on the far side of the cove, John, I’m
sure, and it was the eastern edge or hill at the
entrance that cut it off! Ease off the sheet and
head for there!”</p>

<p>John did as Stan said, for he had great confidence
in his chum’s ability and hunches, and the
<i>Water Witch</i> heeled lively and spryly right between
two high banks of woods, through a clear
channel into the darkness of the cove!</p>

<p>The light, which had been the cause of their
success in finding the entrance, had gone and there
was neither sight nor sound in the darkness. The
hills seemed to surround the spot and the lighter
blue of the sky overhead, now starlit, seemed to
rest upon the edges of the hills.</p>

<p>“Pheww!” breathed John, deeply, from the
wheel, as the sloop rounded to and the anchor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
dropped with a low splash into the deep waters.
“This place gives me the honorable creeps!
Creeping skeletons, and bleached bones—I’d
rather go to live with Blackbeard the Pirate than
spend the night in Black Cove!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Stan, and his voice was not
too steady, “that we’re here to stay for the night—for
I can’t even guess where the entrance is now!”</p>

The Night in Black Cove</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS JOHN was afterwards to remark, that
night in Black Cove turned out to be “A
night as was a night!” The anchor had barely hit
bottom when a flickering light, as from a half-covered
flashlight appeared in the bushes of the
Island. Stan gripped John’s arm suddenly.</p>

<p>“There’s that light again! Maybe we ought to
shout a greeting——”</p>

<p>“Nix, Stan,” John whispered tersely. “I’ve
a hunch this is a poor spot for innocent sailor men
to be! Just keep mum.”</p>

<p>“Me too, now that I think about it! Look!
The light is going up in the darkness!”</p>

<p>“What’s <i>that</i>?” queried John. “Do you hear
it?”</p>

<p>Both boys listened, but Stan heard nothing
save the water lapping the edges of the cove, which
was about a quarter of a mile across, the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
carrying clearly on the night breeze which curved
down over the bowl of hills and dipped cat’s-paws
at the dark water. The same breeze made the
trees sigh a little, and outside of that there was no
other noise.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a familiar sound, at least a
sound I’ve heard before, like—<i>look</i>!”</p>

<p>The boys saw a shimmer of broken water as
they turned about, attracted by a low humming!</p>

<p>“A boat, Stan, and crossing the cove at good
speed, too! See, there he goes!”</p>

<p>A single blink of light came from the flashlight
on the hill and Stan saw an answering blink from
the boat. Then darkness enveloped all again and
the hum was heard no more!</p>

<p>“This calls for a council and some thinking,
John,” Stan said. “Come on below with me.”</p>

<p>He led the way down into the cabin while the
<i>Water Witch</i> swung at her anchor, her sails flapping
very softly in the night breeze. The little
sloop had thick curtains, which he now drew over
the cabin ports. Then he was heard to close the
slide to the cabin entrance and come back down
the steps. The sputter of a match in the darkness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and Stan was lighting one of the smaller cabin
lights, which he set upon the cabin table upon
which had been spread the chart of Porpoise
Island and vicinity. There was a serious frown
upon his features as the youthful skipper faced his
chum across that table.</p>

<p>“Here’s the situation as I see it,” Stan said,
speaking in a low voice. “This afternoon we saw
a speedy motorboat of low, fast design, painted
an inconspicuous gray and fitted with an almost
silent exhaust, which disappeared round the snout
of this island. Now we’ve come into Black Cove,
a rarely visited spot, and find ourselves in the
midst of symptoms of trouble—a fast, almost
silent motorboat which comes in at night, blinking
signals in answer to shore lights. Is this or is it
not a dangerous spot? Are these innocent happenings,
or should we get out of here and pronto?”</p>

<p>John considered the problem for a minute, for
he knew Stan was in dead seriousness, and besides,
he himself was creepy and scared.</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to think we can’t get out of here
in the dark anyhow, Stan, so we’ll have to stay
here——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“It’s a cinch we’d have trouble finding the
channel, as I said a few minutes ago on deck,
John.”</p>

<p>“—And maybe daybreak will show us up as a
couple of scatterbrained kids. Sweet spirits of
the briny deep—why should anyone hurt us?
We’re only bent on pleasure!”</p>

<p>Stan grinned wryly.</p>

<p>“Sure we’re only pleasure bent, but—what
about our detective stuff, and just supposing that
whoever is here is up to something evil and recognizes
us as the two kids who got their pictures in
the papers over the Hogan case?”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Stan. What’ll we do?”</p>

<p>“My idea is this, John. Let’s up anchor and
move over under sail to the far side of this cove
away from the lights we saw and stay there to-night.
We’ll keep quiet, keep turns watching,
and, unless some one starts something, we’ll let
well enough alone till dawn.”</p>

<p>“I’d sure like to have my bow and arrows on
watch, Stan! Remember how they worked
against Hogan that night he tried to snoop around
at the float-stage back in Centerport?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>They both grinned with delight at the remembrance
of the snooper who dashed off in his boat,
stung in the pants’ seat by a well aimed arrow!
Stan nodded agreement to John’s suggestion of
a defensive weapon, and they prepared to up
anchor and cross the cove.</p>

<p>On deck they took their positions, Stan at the
wheel and the main sheet, John at the jib and
staysail sheets, and the anchor cables. Quietly
Stan gave the command, and John hove in on the
anchor. Slowly the dripping cable came inboard
foot by foot, and was coiled on deck as the youth
hauled at it, then it tightened as the anchor took
up the slack. He heaved hard—but the anchor
did not budge.</p>

<p>Again John tugged. The anchor refused to
give way.</p>

<p>Nervous, John came aft and informed Stan of
the situation.</p>

<p>“Try again, John,” Stan suggested. “Keep
trying. We don’t want to lose that anchor. It
ought to break out o.k. from a loam floor.”</p>

<p>Determined to get that anchor in, John heaved
away, grunting, and—with a snap of release, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
anchor broke ground! Up it came, and John
hauled it wet and muddy on deck. As he did so
he gave a low cry of surprise! But the sloop was
heeling off now as the breeze filled the mainsail and
John promptly “backed” the jib to help push the
sloop onto a course and under way. In a minute
or two the <i>Water Witch</i> was rippling to the opposite
shore from the spot where the flashlight had
glittered a short while before.</p>

<p>Close to the bank the anchor was again dropped
overboard and the cable slacked off. With flapping
sails, the sloop drifted off till the slack was
taken up, then swung to the wind, at anchor. John
said nothing about his discovery in the bows until
the sails had been lowered and furled for the
night, the strops tightened about the canvas, and
the sheets belayed with plenty of slack in case of
rain. The sky was clear and the stars glittered
overhead, but a good seaman always leaves his
running rigging slack at night, for rain would
promptly tighten it and stretch the rope dangerously.
All being snug now, the boys brought their
bows and arrows up on deck, stowed them ready
for instant use, placed a focusing flashlight handy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and held council in the cabin again. It was then
that John Tallman went upon deck to return
with something which he now handed to his friend.</p>

<p>“A brass fitting!” cried Stan, staring. “Where
did you get it?”</p>

<p>“The anchor snagged on something in the cove,
Stan, probably a sunken wreck, and I brought up
this! Piece of brass trimming, isn’t it? Might
be from a yacht?”</p>

<p>“It’s expensive, whatever it belongs to, John.
Fancy trimmings at sea don’t appear on commercial
ships. Yacht is the best guess! Wonder
What a yacht is doing sunk in Black Cove?”</p>

<p>“Maybe that other thing we struck in the bay
was part of a ship, Stan, too!”</p>

<p>“I doubt it, John. Probably just a half-submerged
log. But this brass is definitely from
a wreck, I figure.”</p>

<p>“Listen—What’s that?”</p>

<p>Voices and subdued noises took the boys to the
deck at once, where they carefully shut the cabin
slide to keep the light from showing while they
peered across the water of the cove. There in the
darkness a low boat of some kind appeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
have anchored, and men were moving about on
it, for their footsteps on deck could be heard, and
there were occasional flickerings of light as if a
lantern were in use.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness for one thing, Stan, I don’t
think we’ve been discovered, yet; do you?”</p>

<p>“No. What’s going on over there?”</p>

<p>“Shades of the Caspian Sea and blessings on
thee little man, I wish I knew! Hear that low,
throbbing sound, like a pump working?”</p>

<p>“Probably a salvaging job; but why at night,
John?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Oswald, old bean!” laughed John,
“Why ask me? Your guess is as good as mine.”</p>

<p>The noises of whatever operation was under
way continued for hours, and Stan went down to
his bunk to sleep while John stood first watch. A
low whistle was to be the signal for the G-man’s
son to hurry to the deck should any attack or disturbance
occur.</p>

<p>For a long while John sat huddled in the corner
of the cockpit, thankful for the sweater he had
slipped on, for summer was well advanced and the
night cool. His bow and arrows were handy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
he watched what little could be seen of the strange
things taking place across the water. He could
be sure of nothing, and towards the latter part of
his watch gave up guessing. Probably the men
were salvaging the sunken ship if such the cove
contained. Overhead the bright stars twinkled,
and alongshore in the darkness the leaves switched
in the breeze. John Tallman was not sorry when
his radium-dialed watch showed midnight.</p>

<p>Sleepy-eyed, dog-tired, in spite of the excitement
of wondering what the later hours might
bring, the youth went below to wake Stan. He
found that worthy half-awake, for the sandy-haired
skipper of the <i>Water Witch</i> had slept
poorly.</p>

<p>“I say, a cup of coffee and a doughnut, Stan!”
John said, rubbing his eyes, and then his stomach.
“Cockpits and maintops, but I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>They made coffee and munched doughnuts but
said little about the strange surroundings. Stan
went on deck then and, in his turn, listened to the
sounds of work upon the surface of the cove. He
came no nearer to a solution of the problem than
had John, and went back to bed at four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>The dimly outlined boat moved off before
dawn, and the slowly brightening sky of morning
disclosed only a cool, deserted cove. The surrounding
hills showed only trees, green and thick,
right down to the water’s edge and, in most places,
overlapping the water with widespread branches.</p>

<p>At breakfast, as the sun came over the eastern
hill, the boys gave each other questioning looks.</p>

<p>“If I was not so sleepy, I’d swear I’d been
asleep and dreamed the whole thing, Stan,” John
said, yawning and looking longingly at his bunk.
“Whatever and whoever was at the center of this
cove last night is gone, now.”</p>

<p>“Get some sleep, John, and then we’ll put up
our sails and find the entrance. I’m quite sure it’s
just round that hill over there.”</p>

<p>“Righto, Skipper!”</p>

<p>And the rangy lad hit the bunk with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>Stan worked about on deck, washing the sloop
down, and glancing around from time to time
with interest in the hopes of spotting life along the
opposite shore.</p>

<p>He was thus engaged when curiosity got the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
better of him. He could never, he decided, sail
out of Black Cove without an explanation of what
he and John had seen and heard. He woke his
chum about eight o’clock and suggested that they
swim ashore and look Porpoise Island over.</p>

<p>At first John was reluctant, but he too was
curious, and besides, the warm sunlight had
robbed the pretty cove of its atmosphere of danger.
They might be a couple of young fools,
for all they knew, but they meant to find out.
With the two boys, to come to a decision was to go
into action, and they stripped, slipped into bathing
togs, and went over-side at once. Quickly
and with ease, for they were both fair swimmers,
they covered the few yards of water, swimming
in under the branches of the trees to the rich loamy
shore, onto which they climbed.</p>

<p>Hearts thumping a little, they pushed through
some bushes looking for a path. John was the first
to cry out, being in the lead. Sure enough, there
was a path! A little-used passage through the
bushes and trees, it led them winding uphill, and
they followed it silently with their bare feet making
no sounds. At home in the woods as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
upon the water, the two boys moved onward, alert
for anything!</p>

<p>But nothing happened, at least for a period of
twenty minutes, during which time they passed
several bypaths and went along seeing the glitter
of the cove as they circled it. All of a sudden they
came out of that path, through the bushes right
smack into a clearing in which stood a trim
cottage built of rustic materials. A well built
dwelling, it gave hints of wealth, for it was furnished
with modern windows and the latest type
of weather-resisting roofing. A bright, new pump
stood at a well near the door, and everything spoke
of good upkeep. While the boys stood pop-eyed
with wonder they saw no sign of life.</p>

<p>Then a soft voice broke the silence of enchantment.</p>

<p>“Well?” came the query.</p>

<p>Startled, they turned about to find, standing
right behind them, a peculiar old man! The
peculiar thing about him was the leathery skin of
his face and the paleness of his gray eyes. It was
a kindly appearing face but not one you would
have liked. Something in the set of the smile and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the paleness of those eyes would have warned you
to be on the alert for—unsuspected danger!</p>

<p>“Well?” repeated the man, still smiling.</p>

<p>Stan and John knew that they were trespassing,
and that made them feel guilty. Added to
that was the odd feeling of danger. They exchanged
glances of appraisal with the old fellow;
then Stan spoke.</p>

<p>“That’s a peach of a cabin you have, Mister!”</p>

<p>The man’s face muscles, which had given an air
of tenseness to his smile, now relaxed, and he said,
“I’m glad you like it. I like it myself!”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you!” Stan admitted. “By the
way, we sailed into Black Cove last night not
knowing anyone was around here——”</p>

<p>A look of surprise crossed the man’s tanned
features. His smile disappeared for a moment.</p>

<p>“You sailed into Black Cove?”</p>

<p>“Yes; is that surprising?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, but——”</p>

<p>“Boss!” bellowed some one, and footsteps
sounded in the path. “Boss! They’s a yacht anchored
on the far side of the cove——!”</p>

<p>The owner of the voice appeared from the pathway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and stopped, speechless before the boys and
the old man. If the gray-eyed owner of the cabin
was peculiar, tall, slender, and well dressed, the
newcomer was just the opposite in appearance.
Small-eyed, heavy-browed, and fat-faced, he was
a disagreeable sort of chap. Apparently of
foreign parentage, he was swarthy, and looked as
though he had eaten a great deal for many years
but never bothered to take a bath. His clothes
hung baggy and unkempt, and he gave the air of
being a blundering fool in action.</p>

<p>The old man glared for a split second at the
fat one.</p>

<p>“Dago,” he said, “Meet my guests,——”</p>

<p>“I’m Stanley Sandborn, and this is John Tallman,”
Stan introduced himself and his friend,
and he had a feeling that he was known to the old
man.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” responded their host, smiling
again. “You see, I read the papers every day!
You did a marvelous job in helping capture Mr.
Hogan and his accomplices!”</p>

<p>“Boss—them’s the kids that caught Hogan?”
demanded Dago. His red face spoke volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Dago is troubled with a bad heart, boys, and
doubtless worries about his past,” explained the
host. “I am Mr. Raymond Nevens, and Dago is
my trusted man-of-all-work.”</p>

<p>“The kids what captured Hogan!” stuttered
Dago; then he burst into a volley of strange oaths
ending with, “Of all the blessed luck!”</p>

<p>With a lightning fling of a quickly balled right
fist, Mr. Nevens struck out at Dago! The blow
landed fairly, and the man-of-all-work went
sprawling into the bushes!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER III</small><br>

The Strange Mr. Nevens</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAGO picked himself up, trembling a little,
and the boys sensed a tautness in the relations
of Mr. Nevens and the man, which was relieved
as the old man turned to the boys, winking.
He gave a sly indication of finger to forehead and
his face grew sadly serious. But if Dago was to
be supposed mentally unbalanced according to his
employer, he was certainly sane enough to keep
his peace and Mr. Nevens excused himself while
he stepped to the side of the big man and gave him
an order in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr.—Nevens,” the man responded with
surly, glinting eyes and he moved off towards the
house, to go indoors quickly.</p>

<p>“Dago is more to be pitied than scolded, boys,”
said the charming Mr. Nevens, smiling, “but I
keep him round here on odd jobs for he’s been
with me many years. And now, I want you to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
my guests for an hour or so. Will you come with
me? I’ll show you interesting things.”</p>

<p>They nodded after a careful exchange of looks
and followed their host down the slight grade to
his cottage. The boys observed that, as they
went down the path, the hills on the back of the
spot rose well above them so that no hint of that
habitation was given passing steamers outside
in the bay or the ocean. It certainly was an excellent
place for anyone, recluse or criminal. What
an ideal spot for loafing and camping—a private
cove, with a practically hidden channel, high surrounding
hills, on an island known to be kept for
private use!</p>

<p>“You own this island, Mr. Nevens?” asked
Stan, as the man took them along a pretty flagstone
path up to the front door of the rustic cabin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do own it, boys. How do you like my
little realm—what you have seen of it?”</p>

<p>“Swell, Mr. Nevens. But you must be lonely
here, cut off from the rest of the world!”</p>

<p>The man continued to smile as he replied, “Not
so very lonely, nor so very cut off from the world!
I have my few close friends, my hobbies, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
money enough to satisfy my modest whims.”</p>

<p>Was the wreck one of his “whims”? Stan
wondered, and would have asked a tactful question
about the nocturnal activities of the cove, but
thought it better to hold his peace. If Mr. Nevens
wished to talk about it some hint would be
dropped, no doubt. In the meantime, if nothing
was said by the wealthy host, the boys would
wait patiently. If he were a criminal and the
salvage, if such it be, criminal, time would prove it.</p>

<p>As the trio came up the path and approached
the door Mr. Nevens’ spirits seemed to rise even
higher than usual as do those of some one about to
show you exciting things. The door opened at a
slight touch of the fingers, a fact which startled
both the lads. There was no knob or visible lock!
If it had swung open <i>without</i> that deft touch it
could have surprised them no more!</p>

<p>“Just an invention of mine,” Mr. Nevens said,
noting the look of wonder upon their faces as they
went into the cabin. “Touched in the right spot,
this door opens without effort on the part of the
person. It requires no lock of the usual kind,
however, for I can, by throwing a switch seal it so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
that nothing except an explosive can budge it. I
may some day give that secret door system to the
world. By then, boys, I may, in fact, have perfected
an ‘electric eye’ type of a practical kind
which will open as you walk up to it.”</p>

<p>They found themselves in a large, open sort of
room, luxuriously fitted with everything conducive
to manly comfort. Lounges and big roomy
armchairs were scattered about tastefully. There
were ash trays in handy spots, a beautiful radio
of the latest design, stacks of richly bound volumes—the
whole giving one a startling realization of
what money, in the hands of an eccentric or
comfort-loving man, can do.</p>

<p>“My living room, boys,” said Mr. Nevens, obviously
proud of the spot. “Now, here is the
dining room—the kitchenette and Wan Ho Din,
my cook!”</p>

<p>He had touched another door as he stepped forward
and, as he spoke, they were led into a cozy
room where a long table and many chairs told
of company at the dinner table, and then into the
white kitchenette with its refrigerator, special
cooking range, and—Wan Ho Din, the cook!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Wan Ho Din was yellow, slant-eyed, as was to be
expected, and gave one an impression of bland,
innocent kindliness. But a keen observer, as was
Stan when suspicious, would have noted the same
peculiar hint of watchful questioning and evil
about the eyes. Wan Ho Din would bear watching,
Stan decided.</p>

<p>“Boys like cookies?” asked Wan, offering them
a dish of the tasty morsels. “Help self. Takum
hand full!”</p>

<p>Stan took some and took a bite, then held the
remainder in his hands to be eaten later. John,
however, ate his at once, as was to be expected.
Stan smiled to himself in amusement.</p>

<p>“And now to my laboratories and hobby rooms,
boys,” said Mr. Nevens. “What are your hobbies,
by the way?”</p>

<p>“We’re both keen on archery, Mr. Nevens,”
Stan informed him. “We think sailing and camping
is swell, and detective work is fun too. But
we’ve had enough detectin’ for a while! This
cruise we are on is one strictly of pleasure, if we
can keep it so!”</p>

<p>Mr. Nevens’ eyes seemed to harden a bit, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
they warmed again profusely. And all the while
he maintained that contented, friendly smile
which Stan so distrusted.</p>

<p>If Mr. Nevens’ cabin with its spacious living
quarters and well-stocked larder was interesting,
the laboratories were more so. To reach them
the boys were taken down into the ground through
a cement-lined walkway, brightly painted and
lighted by indirect lighting, electrically. They
were told that the electricity was from a dynamo,
gasoline motor driven, that, from top to bottom,
the place was electrically fitted with every comfort
and convenience. The entrance into the laboratories
was through a heavy, fire-proof, explosive-proof,
water-tight door.</p>

<p>“Dynamite would not distort or open this door,
nor could water get in, even under pressure, nor
fire at 1,000 degrees burn through in less than
twenty-four hours,” Mr. Nevens explained. “I
have taken these precautions because I am working
on many important discoveries and cannot
afford to lose the result of years of work. See,
here is a television set upon which I am working,
built on a principle entirely new in the field. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
it I hope to be able to show people in three dimensions
upon a special ‘view-disk,’ or panel, instead
of the two-dimensional scene of conventional
models. My subjects would be rounded and
natural instead of flat. And here is a device which,
when perfected, will throw a stream of bullets in
a carefully controlled sweep at previously unknown
speeds and with terrible effectiveness. You
see, I am interested in armaments——”</p>

<p>The look upon Stan’s face must have spoken
volumes for the eccentric inventor hurried to say,
“—Purely from a desire to invent so terrible a
weapon eventually that warfare would be impossible
without race suicide, boys. Unlike most
Pacifists, I believe in fostering the arming of
nations so that they will be armed to the teeth, all
of them, and therefore afraid to start a war for
fear of its consequences to all!”</p>

<p>They were then shown a number of other things
in process of development, and still others were
left unexplained, after which the party moved on
to the exit and passage, up to the surface of the
ground. What intrigued Stan was the number of
passages honeycombing this underground retreat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
No explanation for their presence was forthcoming
and he made a mental note to investigate
should need arise.</p>

<p>The exit on the surface came up in a glass-domed
summerhouse in which were platforms of
fine flowers, and a large and well-stocked aquarium.
Mr. Nevens knew all of his plants and fishes
well and they found him an interesting talker.
From all indications he was well-traveled and
well-informed. And on every side were indications
of plenty of wealth.</p>

<p>After visiting the summerhouse, Stanley and
John were escorted into the surrounding hills
from whose summits they could see clearly in all
directions along the back of the “porpoise” out
to sea, and across the bay towards the distant
spires and factory stacks and the Watch Tower
Hill of Centerport. Paths in a veritable labyrinth
of foot-ways radiated in and about the hills, but
Mr. Nevens’ easy-going guidance gave hints that
he was avoiding several by-ways purposely.
What might some of these paths lead to? Stan
meant to find out later!</p>

<p>The <i>Water Witch</i> was almost hidden on the far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
side of the cove against the background of trees
and it certainly looked good. The entrance channel
to the cove was seen as a narrow slit, cutting
at an angle through the hills to the sea, and Stan
made mental notes of its position. While they
stood on a rock atop the highest hump of land,
Mr. Nevens’ eyes rested rather long upon the
moving form of a yacht which was coming in from
the sea. White and shiny with brass work, the
pleasure craft moved in the general direction of
the island, though still some miles away.</p>

<p>“You will come back to see me again, boys,
won’t you?” asked Mr. Nevens as they went down
the hill. “I’ll show you my landing-stage and
boat-house so that you’ll know where to tie up next
time. You must come and spend a few days with
me soon.”</p>

<p>This tactful remark could mean only one thing,
since Mr. Nevens knew that the boys had intended
staying in the cove longer than that one
day. There was no alternative but to say what
Stan now said.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Nevens. We’re pushing off
now for a cruise further along but we’ll stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
back next week if we get a chance!” Was the
coming yacht bringing special visitors for the
queer Mr. Nevens, and on criminal errands, since
he wished the boys to move on now?</p>

<p>They were now shown the boat-house, a carefully
laid out spot with a wide, high entrance into
which a boat could come to land passengers and a
mooring-stage beyond for bigger craft. The
sudden disappearance of the speedboat of the previous
night was now explained and Stan and John
looked at each other with knowing grins.</p>

<p>At the mooring-stage was a fast-appearing
speedboat of gray color and fast design, low in the
water, with no visible exhaust, and fitted for luxurious
water travel at high speed. The long,
hooded middle section betrayed the huge, powerful
engine hidden there. And in the “driver’s”
seat sat a clean-shaven, uniformed attendant at
ease, smoking a pipe quietly. Stan got an impression
that the man was there in case of urgent need.
Perhaps such a man was kept handy day and
night!</p>

<p>Bidding their host at last good-day, the boys
now went past the cabin, and up into the path<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
round the cove. They wound along through the
bushes a few minutes later, quietly, some sixth
sense warning them not to comment on what they
had seen and this caution was rewarded for, silently
as they went in their bare feet, they came
face to face with Dago! Startled, for he had apparently
heard nothing of their approach, the
swarthy fellow purpled and went pop-eyed.
There was no doubt in the mind of the G-man’s
son that Dago, insane or not, had a healthy fear
of him and his friend and desired no part of their
company.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Dago,” John greeted him. “Nice
here on the island, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s-a fine! I think I get along. Don’t
see too much!”</p>

<p>And he was gone!</p>

<p>“‘Don’t see too much,’” echoed John.</p>

<p>“Evidently Dago speaks his thoughts out loud
at times! John, he’s scared of us, for certain!
I wonder if he really is insane?”</p>

<p>“Plump, juicy pineapples, and packages of
bird seed, how do I know, Skipper?” John rejoined.
“All I’m sure of is—I don’t trust him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Quiet, John,” Stan cautioned, hoping their
conversation had not been heard.</p>

<p>They returned by the path to the spot opposite
the sloop, pushed down through the bushes to the
water, plunged in and swam to the craft, hauling
themselves aboard.</p>

<p>“Boy, what a relief to be back on the old <i>Water
Witch</i>! Sides of bacon and rally round the gang-plank
with a heigh-nonny nonny and a heave-ho-ho!”
cried John. “Me for the pantry! Those
cookies only made me more hungry.”</p>

<p>Stan went below behind John and both boys
gave cries of astonished anger! The cabin had
been ransacked! Everything was upside down!
The G-man camera had been smashed! The
fingerprint powders were scattered about.
Papers, notes, books, and letters were spread
about on the bunks and floor!</p>

<p>“Dago!” cried John at once. “I’ll tie that chap
with telephone wire and douse him in a cup of
vinegar, so help me! Bring on the boiling oil!
Where is my wandering——”</p>

<p>The tall lad began at once to pick things up, but
Stan stopped him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Remember what Dad always said, John—study
the situation, look for clues before disturbing
things too much, in a case like this!”</p>

<p>This they now did, making notes of how things
were, accurate sketches showing the positions of
each object; and then they looked for fingerprints.
They were rewarded only by the discovery of a
pair of rubber gloves at the foot of the steps.
Large sized gloves, they had been tossed aside by
the intruder as he left, in a hurry. Stan recovered
enough of the fingerprint powders to bring out
smudges on various objects but could find no
prints. The man who had been aboard the yacht
had been lucky, if not careful.</p>

<p>The things were then picked up and set to
rights, and Stan was the first to voice an opinion
of what had been the purpose of the search.</p>

<p>“From what I see, John,” he said, “Dago may
have been sent aboard here to go through our
letters and personal things and to destroy the
camera. There might be something among the
things to show that we were purposely looking up
Mr. Nevens, you see. If Dago found nothing,
our claim of being merely pleasure-bound would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
appear more reasonable. The breaking of the
camera was probably Dago’s idea!”</p>

<p>“But if Dago came aboard, how did he get
here?” John wanted to know. “By the shores of
the Red Sea—he didn’t swim it, for his clothes
were dry when we passed him.”</p>

<p>“Probably made it in a boat, of course.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the boat, then? And why would he
be on the path instead of back at the boat-house,
then?”</p>

<p>For answer, Stan dug out a pair of binoculars
from a closet and went up on deck. Keeping the
cabin between him and the direction of the boat-house,
he studied the shore line close by as if looking
for something. It took several minutes, but
at last he sucked in his breath hard and handed the
glasses to John.</p>

<p>“See that spot over there, John?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see—there’s a punt hidden under
the overhanging branches of a tree! And that is
how Dago came aboard!”</p>

<p>Stan smiled. “You didn’t figure that out all
alone, did you, Sherlock Holmes?”</p>

<p>“All kidding aside, Stan, why would he hide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the punt instead of going back and forth from the
float-stage and boat-house?”</p>

<p>“Naturally, so that he would not be noticed.
He probably followed the shore of the cove from
the stage to our boat, under the branches out of
sight, and then returned part way, to hide his
punt.”</p>

<p>“Stan, by all the constellations in the deep blue
sky—I’ve an idea we’re on the trail of something
big, so big it frightens me stiff!”</p>

<p>“Me too, John, but we believe in law and order
and the power of the right, and we’ll see it through
somehow! Mr. Nevens may be merely an eccentric
millionaire with a flair for hobbies and an inventive
trend, but I’ve a hunch he’s a poseur up to
something immense in crime! Look—there comes
that yacht we saw from the hilltop!”</p>

<p>The nose of the shiny white yacht had poked
into the cove and the whole boat now slid into view,
riding easily towards the float-stage. Through
the glasses the boys saw men about her decks
in uniform, probably sailors of the ordinary sort.
And the men on her glass-enclosed bridge were
ordinary-appearing men of wealth. “<i>Sea Hawk!</i>”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
said Stan, reading her name plate. “So what,
Skipper?” John queried.</p>

<p>“Used to be a notorious rum-runner, John, if I
remember the newspapers and magazines rightly!
John, let’s get out of this cove and stay out—while
we’re alive and breathing. I’ve an idea trouble
is brewing for us, and we’d better be hitting the
high spots of speed right off!”</p>

The Mystery of Black Cove</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE G-man’s son hurried below decks with
John, and they changed to their white sailor
pants and white jerseys. As they did so, Stan
gave a low exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“Look, John, I didn’t notice that—the man
who came aboard our sloop did not take along the
brass fitting from Black Cove!”</p>

<p>“Probably didn’t recognize it as of value,
Stan,” John suggested. “Dago wouldn’t be
likely to think of it, unless he’s brighter than I
think he is! ‘From sea to shining sea,’” laughed
John, “I’ll never forget how scared Dago was and
still is of the boys who helped get Dapper Dan
Hogan! Such is the result of publicity and luck!”</p>

<p>“Stow the gab, sailor,” Stan said, grinning,
“and put down that doughnut you just reached
for. We’ve got work to do.”</p>

<p>He hurried to the deck and began taking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
strops off the furled mainsail, and the lanky youth
ran to the jibs to do the same. In a few minutes
the mainsail was being raised till the throat of it
was taut. Then the peak went up tightly, and
the jibs were raised. The <i>Water Witch</i> was filled
off in the fitful noonday breeze puffing into the
cove, as the anchor broke ground and was hauled
aboard. Dipping with a courtesy, and rippling
along, the black sloop crossed the cove, and as
she did so John lay in the bow, peering over as
casually as possible, as if idling on the deck. To
anyone watching from the hills he would have appeared
to be killing time, but in reality he was trying
to see below the surface of the cove!</p>

<p>Shaking his head negatively after a few minutes,
John sat up while the center of the cove was
left behind and the <i>Water Witch</i> came into sight
of the channel entrance. Outside a brisk sea was
running, for the breeze, which dropped only fitful
cat’s-paws down into the cove, was blowing steadily
in the open. Whitecaps shattered and broke
along the tips of the rollers, and the <i>Water Witch</i>,
with sheets eased, ran out through the channel
rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“A swell day for sailing, Stan!” John called
back. “Let’s head for Europe!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got plenty to do at home, John,” Stan
replied. “Come on aft, and let’s figure things out,
if we can.”</p>

<p>Grinning happily as the sloop ran lee rail deep
through the marching waves, John came aft to
the cockpit, reached into his pants’ pocket for a
doughnut, and sat back to talk and eat.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it—(crunch-crunch)—all figured
out, Skipper!” John said.</p>

<p>“Let’s have it, old boy.”</p>

<p>“Well—(crunch-crunch)—let’s sail to another
cove farther down the island,” John said triumphantly,
“getting in there—(crunch-crunch)—after
dark, and then come back to our cove overland!”</p>

<p>“Go get yourself a brace more of doughnuts,
John,” Stan said, chuckling, “if you can get
schemes like that out of a doughnut! Just my
idea too, exactly, and that’s what we’ll do. Let’s
go over to Main Haven for the fun of it, to kill
time.”</p>

<p>“Swell!” was John’s single comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>The <i>Water Witch</i> was cruising quietly along
save for the hum of taut rigging and the splash
and run of water along her sides, for she was trim
of line, fast, and able. Main Haven was a small
port of call on the nearest point of the mainland.
It would take all the rest of the day to reach it and
return, and the skipper of the <i>Water Witch</i> did
not want to get back till nearly dark. There
would be watchful eyes upon the hilltop backbone
of Porpoise Island, if Stan’s suspicions were correct,
and he was already afraid Mr. Nevens suspected
them too.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And Stan was not far wrong.</p>

<p>Back at the cove Mr. Nevens, in the seclusion of
his private office in the back of that wonderful
cabin, was confronting a nervous, apprehensive
Dago.</p>

<p>“Well, did you do as I told you to, Dago?” Mr.
Nevens inquired mildly, sitting back with his feet
upon his desk and a cheap cigar in his mouth.</p>

<p>He’d never been able to take to expensive
smoking, had the peculiar Mr. Nevens. Cheap
black cigars were still a pleasure to him. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
a throw back to his earlier days when he had been
somewhat less than well-padded with money and
power——On the walls of his den were odd
things: a cartridge belt and brace of six-guns
slung in open scabbards. The handles of each gun
had crude notches, several notches. A big sombrero
also hung upon a big peg.</p>

<p>Dago, big and hulky, stirred nervously upon
his great feet before the stare of the tall, lean,
much older man.</p>

<p>“I got out the punt, poled along under the trees
round the cove, without any noise. When I gotta
to the boat, I climbs aboard like you said——”</p>

<p>“Wearing rubber gloves!” interposed Mr.
Nevens, sharply.</p>

<p>“You betta the life I wore rubber gloves!”
Dago came back eagerly, and beads of sweat
began to appear upon his forehead.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said his employer, quietly, puffing
softly on the cigar.</p>

<p>“Then I goes down into the cabin and looks
around. I don’t find nothin’ at all like-a you
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Not a thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>“No letters of any kind at all?”</p>

<p>“Just one letter, like-a from another boy.
They ain’t-a no talk bout you and me in there.”</p>

<p>“You sure you read it carefully, you ignorant
fool?” Mr. Nevens demanded.</p>

<p>Dago trembled a little again.</p>

<p>“I read-a every word-a. Slow. And I <i>did</i>
find-a one those cameras special for G-men!”</p>

<p>Mr. Nevens puffed slowly and hard, his eyes
smouldering. He put his feet down upon the
floor, leaned forward now, elbows on desk, and
staring into Dago’s black eyes.</p>

<p>“And you probably figured you were doing me
a big favor by smashing it!”</p>

<p>“How did you know?” asked Dago, startled.
“I didn’t-a tell-a you!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t have to, Dago. You know that!
I guess I know ten years ahead just what you’ll do
and say any given minute. Twenty years worrying
over you from the Tonto Trail to this place
has taught me that you’re almost more bother and
worry than——”</p>

<p>“I’ll do what you say, Cowboy! Honest I will!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Dago cried as if his employer had threatened him
with death or torture.</p>

<p>“O.k., Dago. I was just giving you fair warning,
that’s all. Now, did you see anything else?”</p>

<p>Dago named almost everything he had handled
in the cabin of the <i>Water Witch</i> and Mr. Nevens,
known as “Cowboy” to his henchman, made no remarks
till Dago casually spoke of “A piece of
brass like-a from a yacht.”</p>

<p>“Brass fitting? Did it have—what was it like?”
Mr. Nevens demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>Dago described it as best he could. Mr. Nevens
purpled till his leathery face was a mask of rage.</p>

<p>“And you left that fitting behind?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I no see what-a good it was!”</p>

<p>Mr. Nevens rose to his feet, suddenly quiet in
manner. He stepped directly in front of Dago
and was about to turn and walk away, dismissing
Dago, when he suddenly asked, “Where are the
gloves, Dago?”</p>

<p>The man stuttered.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard some one coming and I getta
nervous and take off the gloves to put them in my
pocket!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Let’s have them!”</p>

<p>Dago put his hand in his pocket and withdrew
it at once, cursing, and pop-eyed.</p>

<p>“Gone!” he said, simply, and in terror.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At Main Haven the <i>Water Witch</i> tied up to
the steamboat wharf while the two boys went
ashore for peanuts, and a glass of soda. A little
later they climbed aboard again, cleared the harbor,
and headed back for Porpoise Island. The
sun was getting low long before they drew down
on Porpoise Island. The chart showed two good
coves and inlets along both sides, and they chose
one on the further end of the island. It was sheltered,
had good holding bottom, and the entrance
was wide and free of rocks. The breeze was dying
with the setting sun as usual on good summer days
at the Catlow Islands and they slid into the cove,
hours later, on a light night wind, under the stars.
A thin crescent moon hung in the sky, but gave
very little light. It was an ideal night for the
task in hand.</p>

<p>Getting into their bathing suits, the boys prepared
to go ashore. Stanley grinned as he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
a length of cloth and tied the binoculars on top of
his head, so that he looked as though he had a
toothache to boot. Then, thus keeping the glasses
dry, he let himself slowly and carefully into the
water and started for the beach. John followed
as silently as possible and they were shortly
ashore.</p>

<p>“We’ll follow the paths along the hilltops,
John,” Stan said, “till we get to the places we saw
to-day. Then we’ll go along the cove and to the
shore. If we get separated, we’ll meet at the place
where the path goes into the clearing, where Mr.
Nevens confronted us this morning.”</p>

<p>“O.k., Skipper, let’s go.”</p>

<p>Untying the cloth, Stanley tucked the binoculars
under one arm, wrapped the cloth about his
waist for safe-keeping, and they went along in the
starlit darkness adventure bent. It was a matter
of a mile or so to the cabin, and they made it without
any difficulty, for they held to a general direction
by the stars and soon were down on the
shore of the cove.</p>

<p>Out in the center of the cove lights moved about
on a low boat as men worked. Voices drifted back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
but no words could be distinguished. The night
glasses showed the boat to be a low working barge,
and there were five or six men upon it. Among
them the starlight glinted on metal, rounded and
shiny! The startled G-man’s son, grunting,
handed the binoculars to John.</p>

<p>“What do you make out, John?”</p>

<p>“Thunderous herds of beetle-bugs!” murmured
John, “and droves of winter cabbage! A
diver!”</p>

<p>“John, I guess we’re on the trail of something
illegal. Here is a diving operation being carried
on at night. Why avoid daylight, which is dangerous
enough, underwater? What is down there
on the cove floor? And, if a wreck, what does it
contain?”</p>

<p>“Let’s swim out and get a closer look, Stan!”</p>

<p>“Two of us might attract attention. You keep
watch, here, and I’ll go out there, John.”</p>

<p>Protesting, John was left upon the bank, while
Stan plunged in and swam slowly and carefully
out into the cove. John watched the faint ripples
of Stan’s progress for several minutes. Fifteen
minutes went by, during which time he lost track<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
of his friend against the dark water of the cove,
then he heard a loud outcry from the men upon
the barge, saw a rowboat push away, and knew
that Stan had been discovered!</p>

<p>With fast beating heart, John Tallman stared
through the binoculars as the boat rowed hard,
then slowed. That would mean that Stan had
gone underwater trying to elude his pursuers!
Suddenly the shout went up again and the boat
darted off in a new direction. This time there was
a struggling at the end of the row and John knew
Stan had been captured! What could he do to
help his chum? He did not know, but an idea
came to him and he did not hesitate to act upon it.
Undoubtedly they would take Stan to the cabin.
So John did not wait to see that done. Instead,
he darted up the trail, raced pell-mell along the
ridge of the Island for the sloop! It would not
have mattered if it were ten miles to go instead of
two! He had to get there and come back!</p>

<p>In the meantime Stanley Sandborn sat huddled
and cold in the bottom of a boat while he was
rowed to the barge. There he was hauled dripping
to the deck and stood up in the middle of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
group of hard faced men. One of them was
Mr. Nevens!</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, and what are you doing, snooping
round here?” inquired Mr. Nevens.</p>

<p>Stan did not know what to say. If, by any
chance, Mr. Nevens were a law-abiding citizen
and minding his own business, Stan was then a
stupid trespasser! And if he were really a criminal,
Stan’s remarks could not release the youth.
The boy held his tongue and made no reply.</p>

<p>“Take him to the house, Dago,” ordered Mr.
Nevens, “and stick him in room 8.”</p>

<p>Dago grabbed the youth by the nape of the
neck with evident delight at his opportunity, and
half flung, half pushed him into another boat.
Then he pushed off and began rowing ashore with
his captive. But he had not reckoned with Stan’s
brains!</p>

<p>They had hardly got halfway to the boat-house
when Stan pointed ahead. “Look, Dago!” he
said, as if surprised.</p>

<p>Obligingly, Dago turned to glance over his
shoulder. There was nothing unusual there. The
big yacht had gone, and no lights showed. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
turned back, angrily—and his eyes popped! Stan
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Sick at the thought of what Mr. Nevens would
say, and <i>do</i>, Dago rowed in frantic circles trying
to find his escaped prisoner! When Stan broke
water, after a minute of stiff swimming, he came
up yards from the circling boat.</p>

<p>Afraid to yell for help, yet afraid to lose Stan,
Dago grunted savagely and rowed towards the
youth.</p>

<p>“Dago, you fool!” cried Mr. Nevens from the
barge. “Where you going to?”</p>

<p>“It’s o.k., Cowboy, o.k.!” Dago replied, cheerfully,
then bent to his oars, cursing under his
breath.</p>

<p>It was twenty minutes before he closed again
with the desperate youth and hauled him, fighting,
aboard. Then he gave the youth such a clip under
the short ribs that Stan lay doubled over, sick and
gasping, while the boat was rowed to the boat-house.
He was still weak and sick when Dago
carted him ashore and began marching him up the
path to the cabin!</p>

<p>But, sick as he was, Stanley Sandborn was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
licked yet, and, as his breath came rapidly back,
and they neared the door of that cabin, Stan took
one deep breath, and darted off across the clearing!</p>

<p>He made a path before Dago and led that
worthy a merry chase. Had he been fresh, Stan
would have easily gotten away. As it was, Dago
was just a step or two behind all the time, and
Stan eluded capture for a while only by twisting
about and turning from the outstretched hands
of the man.</p>

<p>Dago grabbed him again, however, and triumphantly
dragged him towards the cabin door,
hugely satisfied with his luck in at last cornering
the youth. This time Stan would not escape him,
he said aloud, and got an even tighter grip upon
the youth’s right arm. Stan knew that this time
he could not escape, being winded, sick, and
gripped by a powerful hand. Frightened, but
game, he was dragged to the cabin door, and
Dago reached out his hand to press upon that
door.</p>

<p>Even as he did so he gave a loud outcry of pain!
His hand let go of Stanley, and he began running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
in short circles, grabbing at his pants’ seat, and
bellowing with alarm as if stung by a whole nest of
hornets!</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h!” he bellowed, “I’m dead, dying!
Ouch! Fire, bees! Wan Ho Din, help!”</p>

<p>Stanley Sandborn thought himself too tired to
run, but he now seized his chance and darted for
the path to the cove! There he almost collided
with his chum. The two of them headed for the
hilltop and towards the <i>Water Witch</i>.</p>

<p>And it was not until they slowed down to catch
their breaths some distance from the cabin that
Stanley turned looks and words of inquiry upon
his friend.</p>

<p>For answer, John handed Stan an object he had
been carrying.</p>

<p>It was his bow. And he had three or four
arrows tucked away in a light quiver over his
shoulder!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER V</small><br>

Fighting for Life</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY paused but little in covering the distance
to the cove where their sloop lay at her
anchor and less time was taken in swimming out
to her. Clambering aboard they hauled up the
mainsail and foresails as rapidly as possible,
swung the anchor aboard and laid a course at all
possible speed for the comparative safety of the
open bay. Far across the water glittered a few
lights—the outposts of Centerport’s homes, and
towards those lights the boys now headed with
sheets eased before the steady bay breeze. Dipping
and swaying, the brave little vessel raced for
home.</p>

<p>At the wheel John did an expert job of getting
every bit of speed out of the boat, as they left the
western end of Porpoise Island. Stan sat in the
cockpit, watchful eyes studying the fading outlines
of the island against the stars, as if he expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
something to be seen there. His hunch
proved right, for he gave a low whistle and
pointed aft.</p>

<p>“See, John! Lights! The pursuit is on! We’re
in for something and it isn’t play!”</p>

<p>“But, if Mr. Nevens really is after us, why
didn’t he try to find and catch me, Stan, to-night,
instead of just sending you off with Dago?
Modest piles of doubloons, and knee-deep heaps
of silver bullion!”</p>

<p>Stan had briefly told of his part of the adventure,
confirming John’s visual knowledge of what
had happened out on the cove and John had told
of his race for the bow and arrows, and of arriving
just in time to wing the bulky Mr. Dago. John’s
suspicion was sound—why had not Mr. Nevens
ordered an immediate search for John, since he
knew both boys very likely would be about the
island together?</p>

<p>“I figure he did, as soon as he could without
scaring us too seriously. John, that man is up to
some nefarious work and he wants to keep us innocent
of the facts. But he’ll catch us if he possibly
can! And, unless I’m far wrong, we’ll hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
water spraying from the bow of racing speedboats
long before we hear their motors!”</p>

<p>“Let them come, Stan. We’ll fight.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget this, John—we’ll be fighting for
our lives! And it will be bows and arrows against
bullets!”</p>

<p>“Chills and fevers! Bones of long-lost galleons!”
John cried. “Do you really think they’d
kill us?”</p>

<p>“I do! We’ve got a reputation, John, as
Sleuths, and they know we’ve got clues enough to
start an investigation. Any attitude of innocence
we may have kept up was finished by my swim into
the cove to-night!”</p>

<p>Lights were now winding down into the cove
the boys had just left, but Stan was wrong in one
thing.</p>

<p>“Get those kids alive, do you understand?” Mr.
Nevens, back at the barge, had ordered as soon as
Stan had been spotted in the water of the cove.
As soon as Dago had captured Stan and was taking
him away in the rowboat, another boat had
pushed off to the other side of the cove, bearing
two men with lights. And still others had begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
to scour the island in other directions. Only the
bare feet of the boys, treading in silence and speed
along the pathways, had saved them from being
taken before reaching the <i>Water Witch</i>—that
and the fact that Mr. Nevens and his men did not
know where the sloop was anchored. He had
ideas, but it would take time to verify them.</p>

<p>One speedboat from the boat-house had gone
humming out of the channel and along the sea side
of the island, searching for a little black sloop.
Another had followed the first outside, then
turned eastward, rounded the snout of the Porpoise
and gone down the north side. But Porpoise
Island has dozens of fine little anchorages
along its shores and it took time to go in and out
in the dark with all eyes watching for a tell-tale
mast against the stars and an almost invisible hull!
That alone had helped to delay the pursuit so that
the <i>Water Witch</i> was well on her way before the
men had covered the island and surrounding
waters.</p>

<p>“They ain’t-a here, men!” Dago remarked, in
one of the gray boats, the one in the bay. “Let’s
swing out and zig-zag the bay. I’d like ta get my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
paws on the kid that slung that arrow! I break-a
the neck!”</p>

<p>“Talk’s cheap, Dago!” remarked one of the
other men who, at the wheel of the swift boat,
guided it expertly across the dark waters while
spray cascaded on either side. “You hurt either
of those kids and Cowboy will chop your ears off!”</p>

<p>“I s’pose he wants-a to make soup of them himself,
eh, Butch?” queried Dago sarcastically.</p>

<p>They could cover the miles back and forth
across the bay at an alarming speed, zooming almost
in silence save for the constant rasping of
spray flying like sheets of metal, so fast was the
passage of the powerful boat, bouncing and
plunging in long swoops through the waves.
They passed within a hundred yards of the <i>Water
Witch</i> twice and did not see her, then Dago began
using a potent searchlight which he swung in all
directions. Mile after mile they raced, Dago urging
more and more speed, confident that the sloop
could not be far towards Centerport yet.</p>

<p>Then the light fell upon white canvas for a
split second!</p>

<p>“There she is! Circle back!” ordered Dago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>They swung and skidded on a sharp turn, came
humming back, the searchlight played on canvas
again, and the boat closed in!</p>

<p>On the <i>Water Witch</i> the white spray of the
searching boat had been long audible and visible
even in the night as it raced back and forth and,
knowing that the shortest distance to home was in
a straight line, the sailboat had held its course.
But the boys were ready, their bows and arrows in
the cockpit, and sharp boat hooks also handy.</p>

<p>“Let them have a brace of arrows in the most
visible part, John, and put sting in the flight of
those arrows!” Stan remarked. “And don’t quit
fighting unless you’re completely overpowered or
nearly dead!”</p>

<p>“Right, Skipper! See, the searchlight!”</p>

<p>Back and forth moved the light, seeking them
out, and on they sailed; then the light blinded
them for a moment! They had been spotted.
The light went past, the spray whipped like a lash
on the breeze, and circled back. The light again
blinded them and this time stayed upon them.</p>

<p>Low in the cockpit, with sheet belayed and the
wheel steadied by his feet against the lower spokes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
while the sloop held her course, John put an arrow
to his bow and drew back the cord slowly. Stan,
in the spot near the cabin slide, did likewise, estimating
the distance and trying to spot an opponent
in the light. Nothing could be seen
but that light, but arrows aimed at it should find
a mark!</p>

<p>Any second might bring the rat-rat of a machine
gun and death but the two chums had been
through that sort of situation before and they
stood their ground, hoping, waiting!</p>

<p>The boat came on towards the <i>Water Witch</i>,
slower now, and began to run alongside.</p>

<p>“You keeds!” yelled Dago. “Come on now,
lay down those bows before you getta hurt! You
come on peaceful and we no—break your necks!”</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to come and get us, Mr.
Dago!” scoffed Stan, loudly.</p>

<p>A loud roar of laughter came from the boat;
the other men were amused at Dago’s sputtering
and swearing reply. Dago was Nevens’ right
hand man, and it amused these lesser henchmen
to see him baited by a couple of boys! Dago practically
frothed with anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“I’ll skin you keeds alive!” roared Dago, and
ordered the speedboat alongside the sloop.</p>

<p>Somewhat accustomed now to the glare of the
light, Stan and John could make out men back of
the searchlight and most visible was big Dago.
As the boat swung over, two steel-pointed hunting
arrows zipped through the air, carefully regulated
by two boys fighting for their lives, so that, allowing
for the rolling boats, and the wind, they would
find a mark! Dago gave one terrified squawk of
amazed agony and leaped backwards right onto
the helmsman! With a sputter and then a cascading
leap of spray off the bows, the speedboat
darted past the stern of the <i>Water Witch</i>!</p>

<p>The boys lost no time getting in two more arrows
and from the yells of pain, those stinging
barbs must have gone into flesh! A hunting arrow,
at that range, is a penetrating projectile and
there would be no more pursuit that night from
the gray speedboat.</p>

<p>In the cold waters of the bay a fat, swarthy man
swam slowly and painfully, bellowing to the stars
his opinion of bows and arrows, cold water, fools
of helmsmen, and the two boys in particular. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
wounded helmsman, for he had received the second
brace of arrows as well as one of Dago’s big feet
in the face, lay helpless and moaning in the boat
while the others attempted to find Dago who had
fallen overboard. They circled slowly, using the
light, for a full half hour, before locating the
center of the volley of exploding oaths and yells,
then pulled the wet and wounded Dago into the
rear compartment of the boat.</p>

<p>“Head for Porpoise Island,” ordered Dago.
“We need an army and navy to getta those
keeds!”</p>

<p>Humming, the boat made her way back to
Porpoise Island and into the channel and the cove
to find the other gray boat also back at the boat-house.
A nervous group of men, to the number
of twenty or more, filed into Mr. Nevens’ den a
little later. These men, with the exception of
Dago and a very few others, were usually hidden
away in the side-passages of the underground part
of the cabin during the daytime, to emerge at night
to do the bidding of their chief. Naturally, Mr.
Nevens had avoided these alleys when showing
his young guests about during the daytime. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
he sat in his chair, feet on desk, smoking a black
cigar. He was not pleased.</p>

<p>“Here I send you fellows out to pick up a
couple of young kids and you muff the thing,”
Mr. Nevens said, softly. “And yet you expect to
be big shots in the plans we’ve got mapped. What
good are you, the lot of you?”</p>

<p>“Cowboy,” Dago admonished, “did you ever
get an arrow stuck in you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Nevens smiled slowly and expansively.</p>

<p>“No,” said he, happily. “But, if you get any
more, I’ll mistake you for a pincushion!”</p>

<p>The <i>Water Witch</i> had now taken an abrupt
change in her course. Left behind were the lights
of Centerport. Instead, she was shaping her way
westward towards Point Zenith and the village
there.</p>

<p>“There’s an ideal spot, just round the point,
for what I’ve got planned, John,” Stan explained,
as he stood his own trick at the wheel while John
brought up a bag of doughnuts and sandwiches.</p>

<p>“What you planning, Skipper? You know,
they’ll be after us at daybreak! Honey-coated
biscuits—how that Dago loves arrows!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>His last remark was an afterthought and both
boys chuckled with amusement.</p>

<p>“They’ll search for us till they find us, John.
But I’ve got a plan.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“A plan that ought to work, unless I miss my
guess, at least till we get the dope on Mr. Nevens
and his crowd.”</p>

<p>John was consumed with curiosity.</p>

<p>“Batten down the main hatches and show the
cook the door—give us the plan before I bust!” he
cried.</p>

<p>“First, we’ll buy some white paint at Zenith
Village, John, and at daybreak paint the sloop
white. We’ll keep the sails furled, except the
jib.”</p>

<p>“Except the jib?” asked John, mystified.</p>

<p>“Sure—we’ll take that off, and also the bowsprit!”</p>

<p>“I get it!” John said, admiringly. “You’re
going to re-rig the <i>Water Witch</i>!”</p>

<p>“Exactly. But first, I want to disguise her till
we can get a Marconi mast, new sails, and a chance
to paint the underbody and the top sides.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“The name, Stan!” warned John.</p>

<p>“Of course, we’ll have to change the name. Too
bad, too, because I like the one she has!”</p>

<p>It was indeed too bad to have to so change the
<i>Water Witch</i> but there seemed no other way out.
As Stan knew, they must not be recognized at
Porpoise Island as the sloop which had been poking
into the affairs of Mr. Nevens. Besides, the
Marconi rig should be faster and easier to handle.
It would prevent them from going under the
bridge at Lape’s Island and mooring at their float-stage
but that problem would have to be faced
later. Stan and John were sensible enough to
realize that their lives hung in the balance and they
must meet things as they came.</p>

<p>“Maybe Dad could suggest a new name, John,”
Stan said quietly.</p>

<p>“Then we’re going to let him in on the case,
Stan?”</p>

<p>Stan grinned in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Sure—of course. I wouldn’t dare to do this
unaided! We can take care of the changes in the
boat and do a lot of detective work alone but, in
the showdown, if this Mr. Nevens is a big criminal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the F. B. I. has got to be in to take the men prisoners.
Say, Dad will think us a couple of fools for
luck, won’t he! We go on a pleasure cruise, and
right smack into more trouble!”</p>

<p>They rounded Point Zenith under the red
gleams of the blinking lighthouse and came to an
anchor in a secluded spot. As the sails came down
and were stropped for the night, Stan explained
what else he had in mind.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get to Centerport after disguising
the boat, John, and get in touch with Dad.
Then we’ll have to get our new mast and sails out
and rigged soon. We’ve got <i>work</i> ahead of us!”</p>

<p>“And what gets me, Stan, is—why won’t Mr.
Nevens and his playful boys recognize you and me
even if they don’t know the new sloop?”</p>

<p>“Simple. He’s only seen us a matter of an
hour or so, except for the pictures the newspapers
printed, and all we have to do is change our clothes
to something quite different from our usual ones
to disguise ourselves. Hats will help a lot!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” asked John, “that a lavender
and pink sweater in stripes would be inconspicuous?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER VI</small><br>

Conference with a G-Man</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS well after midnight before the two
boys turned in for the night, setting their
alarm clock to ring at daybreak. And at dawn
they awoke and held council.</p>

<p>“The village stores open about seven-thirty or
so, John,” Stan said as they ate a hearty breakfast.
“You go for the paint while I get out that
small can of black paint we had left from the last
job and mark out a new name. What will we
call her now?”</p>

<p>“Not going to ask your Dad?”</p>

<p>“I think not, because, I’ve a hunch the Porpoise
Island crowd may poke into here looking for us
and if we have a new name on the boat it will help
disguise her. What do you suggest, John?”</p>

<p>“Let’s call her ‘<i>Staghound</i>’!”</p>

<p>“Sounds o.k. That was the name of a famous
clipper, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“<i>Staghound</i> it is then!” Stan rejoined.</p>

<p>Breakfast finished, and time drawing on towards
the opening of the stores, they set the mainsail
and took in the anchor. They sailed to the
landing of the town and moored to the pilings
there. The tide was going out and, by fastening
her properly towards the shore end of the pier
they knew she would be almost high and dry at
low tide, resting on the sand. This would enable
Stan to paint in the lettering and John to help
slap the white paint onto her hull. John hurried
for the paint and Stan went over-side and, standing
up to his neck in the water, began blocking
out the new name over the old name. He was still
so engaged when John came back lugging the new
paint and a small can of tan top-side paint for the
cabin.</p>

<p>With the black paint left from the time the
<i>Water Witch</i> had been painted at Cedar Island,
Stan began painting in the new name neatly while
the tide dropped and left him standing up to his
knees in the water now. In the meantime John
had washed down the rest of the hull and was repainting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
it white. It had to be a heavy, well
spread coat to cover the old black, but John was
equal to the task, and by the time the tide was
coming back, towards noon, both boys had put
finishing touches on the white and were giving
the top sides—cabin trunk and top—a coat of tan.
At dinner time they were amused by the townspeople
who came down to witness the changes in
the <i>Water Witch</i>. After a good meal, they went
back to work, sawing off the bowsprit, after taking
down the outer stay to the mainmast head and
unhooking the jib. A plane from the tool box
now came in handy to smooth down the stump of
the bowsprit, and putty and white paint with
a tan topping soon disguised the bow of the <i>Staghound</i>!</p>

<p>“Might as well work away and finish the job as
fast as we can to-day, eh, John?” Stan said, as
they dumped the remains of the forward spar
into an old pile of lumber at the end of the wharf.
“Let’s rig a tripod and take out the mast!”</p>

<p>It was a good afternoon’s work to rig a tripod
of oak “sills” from that lumber pile and with a
heavy tackle and the help of a couple of wharf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
“idlers” to swing out the mast and lay it upon the
wharf. By that time an interesting thing had
taken place. One of the onlookers offered to buy
the mast and sails when he found out they were
no longer wanted.</p>

<p>“Don’t know why you want to ruin a good boat,
young fella,” said the man, “but I’ll take that
mast fer a price and the sail, effen you say the
word!”</p>

<p>They dickered over the price a few minutes and
when they were through Stan had some twenty-five
dollars toward the new mainsail and Marconi
mast!</p>

<p>“Just a drop in the bucket compared to what
that new mast will cost, John, but it’ll help!”
laughed Stan. “And Nevens will never know the
mast on another boat!”</p>

<p>All day they had kept a weather eye open for
gray speedboats running in from Point Zenith,
but none came till about supper time. By that
time, as they were about to go below for a meal,
having got the <i>Staghound</i> away from the wharf
on a high tide, and anchored some distance out in
the harbor after the judicious use of a pair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
oars for forced sculling, they were not surprised to
see what they had expected!</p>

<p>Round the point roared a speedboat, humming
softly into the harbor. The boys ducked
below and peered out the cabin ports watching
the boat circle around. Would the men in that
boat recognize the <i>Staghound</i>? But they need
not have had any fear for, without her short mast,
and her bowsprit and without her black sides and
the name on her stern, the old <i>Water Witch</i> was
a strange object, just another white yacht!</p>

<p>“Don’t see them!” came a familiar voice and the
gray boat hummed right past the <i>Staghound</i>!</p>

<p>It was Dago, sitting in the bow seat of that
runabout, a worried frown on his far from handsome
face! Stan could not suppress a gleeful
chuckle.</p>

<p>“How I’d like another pot shot at you, Mr.
Dago!” cried Stan, softly.</p>

<p>John was grinning like a cat.</p>

<p>“Me too. Tamp me down with a ten-pound
weight!”</p>

<p>They watched the boat disappear around the
point again, and then gave sighs of delighted relief.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
They ate with gusto, cracking jokes, and
figuring the size of mast and area of sail needed
for the revamped sloop. The rough estimate of
money involved was a bit staggering but they had
a large sum of reward money due from the Hogan
case and knew that Mr. Sandborn would insist on
lending them enough to take care of the present
need. After supper, their figures in hand, as near
as they could tell, they went to bed to get a few
hours’ sleep.</p>

<p>As they lay in their bunks Stan spoke of the
<i>Sea Hawk</i>, the yacht they had seen in the cove.</p>

<p>“The <i>Sea Hawk</i> figured in several rum-running
cases, John,” he explained, “and got out
of them through technicalities. Fitted out as a
yacht in every way, she can still carry a load of
anything illegal that the underworld might want
to transport or sell! I wonder who owns her now
and why she was at Black Cove. Does Nevens
own her?”</p>

<p>John grunted.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me riddles, to-night, Skipper.
Blast my tenpins and sing out when the whales
breach—but I’ll be glad when this case is solved!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“And why the salvage job in Black Cove,
divers, night work? What ship was she? What
is still aboard her?”</p>

<p>“All I know, Stan, is that Dago is a bad actor,
and Mr. Nevens is no better than he should be!
Think of that secret laboratory, his aquariums,
his underground passages, all his electrical devices!
And none of his boats seem to show riding
lights or running lights at night!”</p>

<p>“Since the law requires running lights when
under way——”</p>

<p>“We didn’t show running lights ourselves last
night, Stan,” John remarked, interrupting.</p>

<p>“That’s right, and well we didn’t, for they’d
have found us sooner!”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, Nevens’ boats break the law all the
time, it seems, and that alone is an indication of
criminal guilt!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, John. I know this much—we’re
on the trail of something big, and it ought
to be out in the open before long when the G-men
get on the trail!”</p>

<p>They went to sleep after that, and the alarm
woke them late that night. They up-anchored,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and sculled into the town pier; then they moored
the <i>Staghound</i> securely, locked the cabin slide
tightly, and hurried through the dark streets
bound for Centerport. The last street car for the
night was just leaving the tiny depot when they
boarded it, and it bore them swiftly towards their
home city, about ten miles away.</p>

<p>They alighted from the car at the center, and
hurried homeward through the deserted streets.</p>

<p>“Nevens will stop at nothing to get us, John,”
Stan said, as they got near home. “So don’t be
surprised if some one is hanging around outside
my house! He could locate our homes from the
street directory and plant watches ’round them.
We’ll have to get in by a roundabout way!”</p>

<p>This they did, going to Stan’s home first, coming
to the house through a back street and over
the back fence, quietly, and being admitted by
Mrs. Sandborn. She was, of course, delighted to
see her son and his chum; so was Mr. Sandborn,
who was reading in comfort by a log fire at the
fireplace.</p>

<p>“I’ll call your mother, John,” Stan’s mother
said, going to the phone, “and let her know you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
are here while you and Stan raid the pantry.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, munching a sandwich,
John talked with his folks over the phone, saying
he’d drop in for the night in a short while. Then
the boys adjourned to Mr. Sandborn’s den where,
amidst curious objects of many sorts, ship models,
deer horns, and guns, the boys related their many
adventures in detail. The good-looking, youngish
G-man listened intently, frowning from time to
time as they talked and asking many questions.
Then they showed him the brass fitting which they
had brought with them, the pair of rubber gloves,
and a few papers with smudges on them.</p>

<p>“Guess you were right, Stan, no fingerprints
on these papers,” said the G-man after a careful
study of the smudges. “And this brass fitting is
part of the rail of some yacht.”</p>

<p>“Who do you s’pose Mr. Nevens is, Dad?” Stan
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, but he sounds very like an old
time Western bandit known as ‘Cowboy Nevada’!
Your description fits him and he has not been seen
about his old haunts for several years. It may
interest you to know that the F. B. I. wants him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
a Federal bank robbery! I guess Mr. Nevens is
due for a little investigation! And Dago sort of
clinches my opinion because he fits the description
of Nevada’s side-kick and companion in crime,
‘Bats Duplisse’—gunman and stick-up artist of
the West.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Dad?” Stan asked;
“and what do you want us to do?”</p>

<p>“Keep right on with your plans. Finish your
re-rigging job on the <i>Water</i>—I mean <i>Staghound</i>—and
then go back to the Island. Get some pictures
of everything of interest, good clear prints.
Get fingerprints of everyone round there, if you
can. This cook ‘Wan Ho Din,’ now, might mean
something to the F. B. I. if we had a fingerprint
to compare with our files. Excuse me a few minutes
while I talk with the Chief and see what he
says.”</p>

<p>He returned to the den fifteen minutes later
after quite a talk on the long distance wires with
the Chief in Washington, and his face was serious.</p>

<p>“I’ve been assigned to this case, boys. I’m
going to look Porpoise Island over for a while.
How and when I may see you again in the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
week or so I cannot be sure, of course, but you
may see me down there and, unless I speak first,
don’t act as though you knew me for, even if we
were alone, spies might be watching and listening.
In a pinch, I’ll find some way of getting in touch
with you, and in the meantime, and at any time,
get a message to 27 Eagle Street, in Main Haven,
asking for ‘John.’ John is a G-man who runs
what appears to be an ordinary grocery store.
Actually, he is operating on a case down there
and will know what to do in a jam.”</p>

<p>After that, John Tallman went home by a back
way to sleep for the night, and Stan hit his own
bed with grateful sighs. It had been agreed that
both boys would remain at their homes for twenty-four
hours, hidden in case Nevens had watchers
on the lookout, then the next night they would
leave early in the morning so that they could pick
up the Marconi mast and new sails at the marine
store. The order was to be placed in the morning,
and, by paying extra, delivery could be made next
day, especially as they could change their sail
plan a bit to favor any small Marconi mast which
the store might have on hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Indeed, next morning Stan was lucky enough
to contact the store on a mast in stock and a sail
and jib to fit! This was great luck. And furthermore,
the delivery was to be made at the wharf in
Zenith Village! It now would only be necessary
for the boys to be in Zenith to sign for the delivery!</p>

<p>But the day at home was a restless one for both
boys. John tinkered in his little workshop down
cellar when not eating, and Stan haunted the
windows, and read from an adventure magazine
between times. His vigilance at the windows was
rewarded late that afternoon when he spotted a
stranger hovering about the next corner. The
man glanced once in a while at the Sandborn home.</p>

<p>The G-man himself had left in the early morning
to go on the case, wearing ordinary clothes
and carrying his service gun in an armpit holster.</p>

<p>He went by street car to the depot and took a
train for Main Haven, arriving there around ten
o’clock. Casually, as if merely shopping, he
drifted into John’s place. The place was empty
of customers at that moment, but he did not relax
his attitude as John, smiling, came forward.</p>

<p>“And what can I get you, sir?” asked John,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
his eyes meeting his “customer’s” with an unspoken
question there.</p>

<p>“Nice lettuce you have,” the G-man said, picking
up a head, and then continuing in an almost
inaudible voice, while examining the vegetable,
“New case. Have you received your instructions?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” rejoined John, winking. “And
very fine it is!”</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll have—say, have you any carrots?”
Mr. Sandborn remarked, and then added, “Seen
anything of Nevens, Nevada, or whatever the
name is?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” said the grocer, quietly. “But
his cook comes in to buy the supplies.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Just what his name is. Nevens took him on
four years ago. I never have seen Nevens himself,
but townspeople have, and it sounds a little
like Nevada.”</p>

<p>They talked in low tones till a customer came
in, apparently interested in the sale of vegetables,
and Mr. Sandborn made a few purchases and left.
The Chief had already contacted the network of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
agents all over the country, and concentration
would soon begin on Porpoise Island if Mr. Sandborn’s
investigations confirmed the boys’ reports.</p>

<p>Having no use for the vegetables he had bought,
he left them on one of the back steps in the poorer
section of the town, in as inconspicuous a manner
as possible, being quite sure no one had seen him
do so, and then went about his other business. He
asked a hundred innocent questions that forenoon,
making notes of everything, mentally, and trying
to piece together parts of the facts. He visited
the library, the yacht club, and the Sailor’s Snug
Harbor, and gathered more facts.</p>

<p>The <i>Sea Hawk</i> was registered in the name of
a “Mr. James Fitch, lawyer,” and her port of
registry as New York. Some of the facts he
learned made him smile, others caused him to
whistle in a low tone. And then he saw a gray
speedboat pulling into the town wharf at noon.</p>

<p>In it was a trio of men, all three stern faced,
all three of medium build and in business suits.
The leader appeared to be harder than the other
two and smoked cigarettes constantly. They left
their boat moored at the wharf and went briskly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
uptown. Mr. Sandborn hurried to John’s store,
slid into the back room, and there opened a small
closet door. He removed his jacket and armpit
holster and hung them on a peg, taking a stubby
revolver from a small shelf and putting that into
his pocket instead. Then he put on his jacket
again and came out through the store.</p>

<p>He went down to the wharf, and, watching his
opportunity, slid open a hatch over a motor in the
gray boat, pulled a wire loose, and went back onto
the wharf to lounge about. He had not long to
wait, for the trio soon appeared, strode briskly
down the wharf, and got into the boat.</p>

<p>But the motor would not start and the leader
seemed impatient. Again the helmsman tried to
start the motor. It sputtered a little but would
not run. At once, of course, people began to come
along the wharf, attracted by the missing motor.
The men seemed anxious to be off. One of them
cursed, and another lifted the hoods over the engines
and began an examination. His ignorance
of marine engines was very apparent, and he utterly
overlooked the detached wire. Mr. Sandborn
leaned over from the crowd and asked,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Won’t run?”</p>

<p>For answer the men glared up at the speaker.</p>

<p>“Mind if I try to start her?” queried Mr. Sandborn.</p>

<p>At that the leader frowned.</p>

<p>“If you can get her started right off—come on
down and try it!”</p>

<p>Obligingly, Mr. Sandborn stepped down into
the boat, and, because he knew something about
marine engines, he went about his work with an
air of knowledge that was convincing. None of
the men and few of the other spectators noticed
when he again attached the wire. He made a fuss
over an adjustment on another part of the motor
and then pronounced her ready to go!</p>

<p>The helmsman stepped on the starter and the
motor purred into action, sweetly and powerfully.</p>

<p>“Thanks; what do we owe you?” asked the
leader.</p>

<p>“Nothing, unless you know where I kin get a
job, Mister,” said the G-man, casually.</p>

<p>The men exchanged looks. The crowd seemed
interested and formed a rooting section. Half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
urged by the mob and mostly by some knowledge
of their own, the men told him to seat himself in
the bow seat, and the leader promised to see his
“boss about a job.”</p>

<p>The gray boat moved swiftly away from the
wharf now, bearing a G-man bent on investigating
what was to prove one of the most cleverly planned
schemes the country has ever known! So stupendous
a crime was planned that, had Mr. Sandborn
known the facts that morning, he would have
stayed ashore and sent in a hurry call for the
entire G-man army. Instead he went blithely to
his duty, playing the lone hand among that band
of super-criminals!</p>

<p>They bore down on Porpoise Island, whizzed
through the channel into Black Cove, and purred
up to the boat-house and float-stage. And Mr.
Nevens himself was coming down the wharf at
that moment, smiling a greeting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER VII</small><br>

Thirty Per Cent or Fight</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WE HAVE a guest, I see,” remarked the
smiling owner of Porpoise Island.</p>

<p>“This fella can fix engines, Boss,” said the
leader of the boat’s crew. “We got stuck at Main
Haven and he fixed the trouble in a jiffy. He’s
outa work and I thought——”</p>

<p>Mr. Nevens, searching the G-man with an appraising
stare, seemed satisfied as he interrupted
the speaker with, “—Yes, we can find work for
a man who knows how to tend marine engines!”</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Mr. Sandborn, “and what is the
pay for the job?”</p>

<p>“Enough to satisfy you, Mister!” Nevens replied.
“What else can you do?”</p>

<p>“Anything that’s wanted.”</p>

<p>“Anything, can mean a lot,” Nevens said, leading
the way to the cabin. “Let’s talk this thing
over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>In his private office he seated himself comfortably
in his chair and, poising his feet upon his
desk, lit a black cigar, and surveyed Mr. Sandborn
more carefully than even before. He saw
before him a medium built man with regular features
of a determined nature and a habit of holding
his hands as if ready to sling them up in attack
or defence. That he might prove a valuable addition
to his staff, Mr. Nevens, alias Cowboy
Nevada, felt rather certain and he was toying with
an idea. The idea involved big things and moves
must not be too fast. Disaster might well result!</p>

<p>“Just who are you?” queried Nevada, quietly,
his eyes watching the G-man’s face intently
through a whisp of smoke from the cigar.</p>

<p>“The name is ‘Happy’ Gallagher,” responded
the G-man, promptly. “I was born and reared
in Kansas City, cut my teeth on a rod, and done
some time in a jail or two till I wised up to the
racket.”</p>

<p>“Just what is your racket, Gallagher?” Nevada
asked, softly.</p>

<p>“Gallagher” grinned and leaned his hands on
the desk as he said, “Doing jobs for big shots!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“For instance——?”</p>

<p>“I was right-hand man to Steve Hackinaw out
in Chi three years back.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Hackinaw was dead so Mr. Sandborn was
fairly safe in that statement. Hackinaw had
been “Big Time” in gambling rackets but was
done in by rival factions. His right-hand man
had been a fellow closely resembling Mr. Sandborn.
Besides, the underworld had lost track of
that “yes-man,” though G-men knew that he was
dead! They had felled him in battle in a deserted
suburban section and the facts had never got into
the papers.</p>

<p>“I been taking it easy last few years, Nevada,”
said Gallagher, “since the heat went on and just
thought I’d try to land a job somewhere. By
good luck I fell in with your men at Main
Haven!”</p>

<p>“You seem to know me, Gallagher,” Nevada
said, blowing smoke rings.</p>

<p>“Who doesn’t? You were big guns in the West
and I’ve always figured you’d be somebody to tie
up with. It sure was lucky of me to run into you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Dago ain’t gonna like it, Gallagher, should I
use you as my trigger man.”</p>

<p>“Who’s scared of Dago, Nevada?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got a little job for you. Dago’s
kind of careless in some ways. I want you to keep
an eye peeled for two young kids that have been
snooping around here the last few days. You’ve
heard of the kids that helped get Hogan?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ve heard of them. Who hasn’t? I’ll
land them if they come round here again! I don’t
like kids anyhow!”</p>

<p>“You do the job right, get these kids unharmed
and turn them over to me, and I’ll make things
right by you, Gallagher!” Nevada promised.
“Dago’s about washed up, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got big plans, Nevada, and you’re the
one to see ’em through!” Gallagher said, in praise.</p>

<p>Nevada patted the six-guns in the scabbards
on the wall.</p>

<p>“Gallagher,” he said, seriously, “when I was
riding the hot towns and the road I didn’t know
what I do to-night. I’ve got schemes up my sleeve
that will make this country sit up and take notice.
Right now I’ve got a network of men from Maine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to California in every big city and most towns—working
for me and the day I’m ready to take
things over in full!”</p>

<p>He made no offer to say more and Gallagher
knew the wisdom of silence, so asked no more
questions. But he knew that this ex-cowboy and
bad-man was now a powerful underworld figure,
and he knew that the search for Nevada was over
the moment the word was sent to Headquarters.
But the Chief would want to get the entire ring,
the entire organization of Nevada’s crime network.
And that would call for evidence, concrete
and definite, and lots of it! It was arrest and imprison
Nevada the bank-robber or wait and nab
Nevada the leader of a stupendous crime syndicate
and gather in his henchmen too!</p>

<p>Now the G-man was able to make use of many
facts not clearly seen before. For a year or more
the F. B. I. had seen the tentacles of a vast crime
syndicate and had been unable to locate the brains
of the system. In Omaha, a man had been kidnaped
and a huge ransom collected. He was released,
but the thing was so cleverly planned that
even the F. B. I. could not yet put a finger on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
man back of the “snatch.” In New York City
the vegetable markets had been paying tribute
to a “cabbage king” in the form of special orders
for cabbage at fixed prices “or else——!” Who
was the “cabbage king”? Police would have liked
to know. The lottery racket was flourishing
throughout the nation. Dozens of rackets were
springing up, never heard of before. And, instead
of being able to trace it to one or two big
shots, the F. B. I. had run up against stone walls
and blind alleys because of crooked lawyers,
tight-mouthed suspects, and the resisting surface
of the underworld. Mr. Sandborn began to see
that Cowboy Nevada was a big cog, if not the
main cog, in this racket business. He had graduated
from small time bank robbing to specialized
crimes.</p>

<p>Now that took millions of dollars of money to
keep “the machinery greased when starting!”
Cowboy had gotten about fifty thousand dollars
from that Federal bank and by the time he’d paid
for “protection” and a “fence” to handle the “hot
money,” there was probably half that sum left
for his efforts. Therefore he’d gotten unlimited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
wealth elsewhere. He might have made the money
in the rackets themselves, but the G-man thought
not. No, Nevada must have struck it rich suddenly
and so got his grip on the underworld and
the making of his syndicate.</p>

<p>Whatever happened, Mr. Sandborn must keep
his identity secret, for these men would delight in
the discovery that he was a law-man, particularly
one of the dreaded G-men. They would find a
way to get rid of him in some unpleasant manner
and take their chances with the F. B. I. proving
murder! He could not even be sure that Cowboy
was not suspicious of him now. Time alone could
prove that. In the meanwhile he must play his
part as a gunman and aide to the syndicate head,
learning all he could, memorizing everything, and
getting to John and the boys all information possible
to help convict these super-criminals.</p>

<p>Dago rapped for admission and upon entering
scowled as he sighted Gallagher. Cowboy,
shifting the cigar from one corner of his mouth to
the other, watched the actions of both men with
quiet amusement, then introduced the G-man to
Dago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Glad to know you, Dago,” Gallagher responded,
offering his right hand.</p>

<p>Dago reddened.</p>

<p>“Well, can’t say I’m-a glad!” he retorted,
ignoring the hand.</p>

<p>Cowboy’s features did not hint what he might
be thinking as he puffed on the cigar without comment.</p>

<p>“Sorry you feel like that, Dago, it might be
better fer you to be friends with me instead of
giving me the cold shoulder. I ain’t never liked
them kind of actions.”</p>

<p>Dago snorted in reply.</p>

<p>“Send up Wan Ho Din, Dago,” Cowboy
ordered.</p>

<p>As Dago closed the door Cowboy grinned at
Gallagher.</p>

<p>“Dago don’t care much for you, Gallagher.”</p>

<p>Gallagher said nothing, but laughed.</p>

<p>The Oriental cook came toddling in softly in a
moment or two.</p>

<p>“You send flo me, Mister Nevens?” asked the
cook, meekly.</p>

<p>“Great act, eh, Gallagher?” queried Cowboy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
laughing, then to the cook he said, “It’s o.k., Wan,
to be yourself. Gallagher here is one of us.”</p>

<p>“That’s swell!” said the Oriental in plain
American slang. “You sure hooked up with the
right outfit when you signed on with—The Amalgamated
Service Corporation of America!”</p>

<p>“Some name!” Gallagher said. “Of course it
ain’t a real one!”</p>

<p>“No?” remarked Cowboy. “Take a look at
that!”</p>

<p>He handed Mr. Sandborn some stationery with
raised, fancy printed headings. The name was
there, in full, with, “Raymond Nevens, President”
in modest letters!</p>

<p>“Official stationery and all, Gallagher! That’s
the way we do things! Like to see the thing
worked?” he asked, his eyes glinting.</p>

<p>“Sure, go ahead, Cowboy.”</p>

<p>“Take a letter, Wan,” remarked Mr. Nevens.</p>

<p>Gallagher took a seat in a comfortable chair
while the cook sat in another seat and began taking
down a letter in short-hand as the astonishing
Mr. Nevens dictated. It was a very cleverly
worded letter which sounded businesslike and innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of wrong-doing but which really was full
of veiled threats and intimidation. Addressed to
a large contracting firm in New York it professed
to offer “night watchman service for which a small
fee is charged, considering the fine service given.”
Actually, anyone on the inside track and knowing
what the wording really meant, as Mr. Sandborn
well did, the letter was an invitation to let the
gangsters have ten per cent of the money received
from every contract, for which ten per cent they
would consent to keep the prospective buildings
free from strikes and trouble while being built.
Actually the letters implied that if this offer were
not accepted serious consequences would result!</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn knew the story of that system
well. And he knew that the contractor, if of the
usual type, would accept the offer because, as
long as that gang existed, not only would his
business be faced with ruin but his life might be
taken as well! New York police could not cope
with the gang for they could not locate its head,
hidden as he was on one of the hundreds of islands
along the coast, and surrounded by an excellent
system of fake addresses, names, and a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
forms of legal detours. The F. B. I., once on the
trail, would have men planted, as was Mr. Sandborn,
right in with the gang when possible, and
so learn its secrets and strike at the right time to
clean up the mob.</p>

<p>“How’s that for a letter, Gallagher?” asked
Nevens, as Wan Ho Din began to type out the
final copy.</p>

<p>“It ought to get results!” agreed Mr. Sandborn
truthfully. “Do you ever have trouble lining the
boys up?”</p>

<p>“Tell him about Teverton Products, Wan!”
suggested the happy Mr. Nevens proudly.</p>

<p>“Teverton Products made woolen blankets,
Gallagher,” Wan said, “and we offered to increase
their production for them by selling their
blankets at higher prices to a string of hotels Mr.
Nevens controls. Teverton Products refused to
do business, partly because we wanted ten per cent
of their year’s business from then on, so some of
the boys did a little night work down there at the
plant and a lot of machinery got bunged up. The
mill hasn’t been doing so well since!”</p>

<p>“People must be fools not to see what we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
to offer,” Cowboy pointed out. “Suppose you’re
in business making, let’s say, broom handles and
handles for tools. Now, you ain’t doing extra
well on account of your competitors is cutting
prices on you. Well, you give us ten per cent of
your profits and we’ll guarantee that your competitors
will boost prices and that you’ll get, say,
one hundred thousand dollars extra business that
year!”</p>

<p>“That’s service!” Mr. Sandborn agreed.</p>

<p>“Well, we got about eighty per cent of the business
in this country lined up now, Gallagher, and
half of it don’t know it yet! But when the time
comes, and it ain’t far distant, we’ll be cashing in
on all of them. I’ve put about eight million
dollars into this business and I’m getting five
times that a year now, returns. I got a nice little
nest egg of reserves left and I’m not sure how
much, either. Bet you don’t know where the reserves
is, either!”</p>

<p>Gallagher admitted that he had no idea where
Cowboy kept his reserve cash.</p>

<p>Wan and Nevens exchanged looks and just
smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“If you ain’t too busy to-night, Gallagher,”
said the amiable Mr. Nevens, “I’ll show you something
that’ll pop your eyes out!”</p>

<p>Dago rapped at that moment to announce
visitors.</p>

<p>“Who is it, Dago?” Cowboy asked, pulling out
another cigar and lighting a match.</p>

<p>“Machine-gun Hegarty hisself aboard the <i>Sea
Hawk</i>!”</p>

<p>Mr. Nevens went taut about the jaws and bit
hard on the unlit cigar.</p>

<p>“Stick around Gallagher, and listen to the fun,”
said he, then to Dago he said, “Send him up, Dago.
And keep an eye on his right-hand man. I don’t
want no junk stolen.”</p>

<p>Now Mr. Nevens, for all his slang and roughness
when in the privacy of his office, could be the
soul of polished gentility when he desired, a
veneer learned at the time he laid aside his old
cowboy trappings and decided to cut himself a
piece of the world’s cake. He displayed this
refined side of himself now by putting the unlighted
black cigar into his desk-drawer and
lighting, instead, one of more expensive make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Machine-gun Hegarty came in with a flourish.
He was some six feet five inches tall, broad-shouldered,
groomed to a nicety, and correctly
attired in every way for yachting.</p>

<p>He did not know Mr. Sandborn, whom he
now met as Gallagher, but the G-man knew him
well. Hegarty was one of those smooth confidence
men with such a legal knowledge and society background
that even his coarser moments of bloodshed
were not provable in court. He had not
acquired his nickname for nothing, for unlike most
of the confidence gentry, Hegarty did not hesitate
to use a machine gun upon his competitors when
necessity required it. Loads of money spent on
skilled and crooked lawyers and great care not to
leave fingerprints near his crimes had kept the
slippery Mr. Hegarty comparatively safe from
the hands of justice; but Mr. Sandborn had an
idea that justice would win the day before long.
The F. B. I. would be interested in Mr. Hegarty’s
entrance into the field of intimidation and the
“service racket.”</p>

<p>“Charmed to know you, Mr. Gallagher,”
Hegarty said, gravely shaking hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>He had a slimy manner about him not to be removed
by his warm brown eyes and his well-shaven
face. Dissipation had left lines about his
eyes and a certain paleness about his jaws and his
thin lips curled back from large teeth. Society
folk spoke of him as “unique.” Mr. Sandborn
thought a snake might be “unique” also, on occasion.</p>

<p>“And now to business, Nevens, old boy,”
said Hegarty, turning to Cowboy.</p>

<p>“You know what my proposition is, Hegarty,”
Cowboy said. “You come in with me on the
society end of this game and I’ll protect you for
thirty per cent of the proceeds.”</p>

<p>Hegarty frowned.</p>

<p>“Be reasonable, my dear Nevens.”</p>

<p>“Thirty per cent, Hegarty. I’m taking the
risks for you. Surely, my good fellow, you
wouldn’t leave me empty handed!”</p>

<p>“It’s too much, Nevens, old thing. I’ve a notion
to disregard you entirely.”</p>

<p>“You forget how unhealthy that might be!”
Cowboy sighed, quietly.</p>

<p>The other shifted in his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“You forget I’ve a reputation with a machine
gun!”</p>

<p>“So has Gallagher, and so has Dago, Hegarty!”</p>

<p>The visitor arose abruptly.</p>

<p>“I can’t pay thirty per cent and I’m not going
to. This is war, Nevens. You may think you
can get control of this entire country, and you’ve
murdered fifty men so far to do it, but I’m not
done yet! Now I’ll make a proposition of my
own—you pay me ten per cent from now on of
your entire income, or I’ll rub you out!”</p>

<p>Gallagher knew that this was preposterous and
so did Hegarty but it was said and done and it
meant war between the two factions. That there
might be instant gun-play in that small room, Mr.
Sandborn had no fear. Both men were crack shots
and each respected the other’s speed in drawing
a weapon.</p>

<p>“Let’s make it a week from to-day, at midnight,
Hegarty,” Nevens suggested.</p>

<p>“Fine, and get your bullet-proof vest on, Cowboy—you’ll
need it!”</p>

<p>The charming Mr. Hegarty left after that
without the formality of shaking hands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Nevens put away the expensive cigar, breaking
it in pieces in the ash tray, and getting out his old
black one.</p>

<p>“Gallagher, I ain’t never seen none of your
shootin’. What say you and Dago show me some
typewriting?”</p>

<p>“O.k., Cowboy, let’s go.”</p>

<p>As a member of the F. B. I., Mr. Sandborn was
an expert shot with side arms, machine guns, or
rifles, far better, in fact, than any of the gangster
rats he had yet met up with. He now followed
Mr. Nevens out of the office and down through
the building into the underground passages. Wan
Ho Din, who had been a silent listener to the
incident, was now sent to get Dago. He returned
presently with the swarthy mobster and the party
adjourned to a special long gallery at the end of
which moving figures traveled on endless tracks
just as in any shooting gallery.</p>

<p>The contestants took turns with revolvers, automatics,
and machine guns and the gallery rang
with the rain of gunfire. It became very apparent
that the new gunman of the Nevens’ gang was
far superior to Dago who had previously been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
best shot in the outfit and the fat man became
angrier and angrier as the minutes passed.</p>

<p>“Well, Dago,” said Cowboy, “I guess that sort
of washes you off the list as my right-hand man.”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing he ain’t done yet, Cowboy,
and you was always one to say it had ta be done
before you’d give me the gate!” sneered Dago,
with hard eyes.</p>

<p>“And what might that be, Dago?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see how good-a this typewriter artist is
with his fist in a free-for-all!” Dago cried,
heatedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn knew what that meant—a fight
free of rules. Anything would go! But he had
to play this game through to the bitter end for the
sake of law and order and the future of the F. B. I.</p>

<p>“Let’s get at it. O.k., Cowboy?”</p>

<p>Cowboy grinned with delight.</p>

<p>“Get going—you two!”</p>

Hegarty’s Plans</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER a restless day at home and an even
more restless night of fitful sleep, both Stanley
Sandborn and John awoke and dressed in the
still dark early morning hours. After bidding
his brave mother good-bye, for she knew that the
boys were mixed up in a dangerous adventure,
Stan left by the cellar door for a very good reason.
His reason proved sound for, as he vaulted
the back fence he could make out, in the darkness,
the figure of a man prowling the front sidewalk.
As luck would have it, Stan fell heavily over
something in the dark, and instantly he heard the
sounds of running feet!</p>

<p>The stranger, who could be none other than a
member of the Nevens gang, was in full pursuit!</p>

<p>Stanley got to his feet as the man came over the
fence, and ran like a frightened hare across the
next yard and down the next street. For several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
minutes he ran, crossing yards, vaulting well-known
fences. He’d done that in play many a
time; now he was doing it in earnest and for life,
and he was grateful for a knowledge of the territory
about his home. So successful was he in shaking
off his pursuer that he was able to get into
John’s back yard just as John came out the door,
and the two of them beat a hasty path down town.
There they ate coffee and ham sandwiches in a
small restaurant, and then walked briskly out of
town towards Zenith. They were a mile or so from
the city when the first street car came along, and
they boarded it, riding the rest of the way to the
village.</p>

<p>Stanley had told of the man who had chased
him, and John, too, had a story to tell, about
another who had hung about in the vicinity of the
Tallman home all that day.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be very, very cautious, John,”
Stan commented, “if we expect to live long
enough to bring this case to a close! I hope no one
has monkeyed with the <i>Staghound</i> while we’ve
been gone!”</p>

<p>They found the sloop untouched, and unlocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the cabin slide. The morning was a bit chilly as
fall was approaching, and the little cook range
soon gave forth pleasant warmth while they discussed
the day’s plans.</p>

<p>“The truck with the new mast, sails, and rigging
should be here before noon, and I’ve got more than
enough money to pay him. Mother drew it out
of the bank for me yesterday. This morning let’s
get the sloop closer inshore, and paint the underbody
red. Then we’ll re-rig the interior here,
make a secret-paneled closet for our fingerprint
stuff and personal treasures, and Dago won’t
know the place if he happens to snoop in here
again, by any chance.”</p>

<p>They got the sloop closer inshore against the
pier, and the tide left her quite high and dry so
that they had no trouble putting a fresh coat of
copper paint, red this time, over her previous coating
of green. The truck brought the mast, sails,
and rigging shortly afterwards, and Stanley and
John set up another tripod of timbers from which
to sling the new spar into place. With the aid of
wharf idlers they soon had the beautiful, tapering
Marconi mast in place, carefully “stepped,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the sails on. The new wire rigging was somewhat
intricate because of the height of the mast, but
it was in place by mid-afternoon and not until
then did they knock off for a meal.</p>

<p>“All I hope, Stan, is that we’ve figured our
sail area and center of that area correctly, or we’ll
have a lemon of a boat on our hands! Sheets of
whistling zinc and tons of paper plates—I’m
nervous about that!”</p>

<p>“With the Marconi rig, John, there is one thing—we’ll
have to try her out and tinker with the set
of the stays until the sails draw right. And we’ve
got to keep an eye on those stays if it begins to
blow up hard. But we’ll be thankful for the ease
of reefing in a blow!”</p>

<p>They set sail from the town wharf before supper
time, and trouble began at once! The boat kept
carrying a “wet nose” with every puff of wind.
And at the same time she was hard to handle with
that wheel.</p>

<p>They shifted a little of the pigiron ballast she
carried under her cabin floor boards, moving it a
few feet further aft, and after a few adjustments
to tip the mast back a few inches, giving it a hint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
of rake, she began to act with the normal airs of a
good yacht. An hour of sailing and minor adjustments
now brought things right, and Stan was
enthusiastic at the way the <i>Staghound</i> tore along
through the water of Zenith Harbor.</p>

<p>They were returning to their anchorage for the
night when John gave an exclamation of warning.</p>

<p>“Duck, Stan! The <i>Sea Hawk</i>!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, standing round Zenith Light was
the white-hulled <i>Sea Hawk</i> which they had seen
in Black Cove. It was moving fast, as if its owner
had business to attend to, and Stan whistled nervously.</p>

<p>“Get into a blue sweater and a white cap,
John,” Stan ordered, “and bring up my old
brown cap!”</p>

<p>By the time the <i>Sea Hawk</i> was closing up, the
two boys could not have been recognized as the
boys of Black Cove even if the men aboard the
yacht had suspected who they were. Seated as
they were in the cockpit, too, their physical differences,
John being so tall and Stanley just
ordinary in height, were not to be compared, and
that helped to hide their identities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“I’d give a good shirt to know what part the
<i>Sea Hawk</i> is playing in Nevens’ life,” said Stan.
“She’s a beauty, though, and reputed extremely
fast.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Nevens has nothing to do with her, you
know,” John said. “She may belong to a friend
of his!”</p>

<p>“What’s she doing in Zenith, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Murmuring fish-hooks—your guess is as good
as mine!”</p>

<p>The yacht rounded to off the pier, let go an
anchor, and appeared to be set for the night. The
sun was setting now, and the boys sought out their
own anchorage and lowered the new sails, keeping
watchful eyes on the big yacht. At supper, Stan
peered through the portholes from time to time,
but nothing of particular interest was to be seen
about the <i>Sea Hawk</i>. Her riding lights were being
set, and, as darkness came on, bright lights
gleamed through her rows of ports. Music from a
radio drifted across the water, and sailors walked
about her decks at work. Once a tender put-putted
away to the wharf with two men in it. They
were apparently seamen and returned a little later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
in the dark with a load of food, Stan having
watched them through the binoculars as they
entered the grocery store near the wharf and came
out with bags.</p>

<p>“Let’s swim over to-night and see if we can
hear anything worth while, John,” Stan suggested
as they sat in the cockpit, listening to the music
and watching the big yacht.</p>

<p>John thought a second or two and then nodded
his agreement.</p>

<p>They donned bathing togs and went over-side,
swimming slowly towards their destination. By
the end of a few minutes Stan drew near to John
and said:</p>

<p>“John, you get off the bow and attract some
attention while I slide to the stern and listen.
There’s a cockpit aft and maybe some one there
may have something to say of interest.”</p>

<p>The boys separated, and John did the crawl
past the bow. A sailor peered over and hailed
him.</p>

<p>“Hey, side-wheeler,” yelled the seaman,
“what’re you doing—swimming the Channel?”</p>

<p>“Come on in, the water’s swell!” John shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Don’t like the water,” laughed the man; “too
wet! Ain’t that right, Slim?”</p>

<p>Another seaman, answering to the name of
“Slim” solemnly informed John that the first
speaker was used to “dry water.”</p>

<p>“Tell me another, Mister,” John yelled, striving
to keep attention focused on himself.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes the youth floated and swam
about round the bows of the anchored yacht, resting
at times by holding to the thick anchor chain.</p>

<p>Round by the stern Stan floated quietly, hidden
by the curving contour of the yacht from view
on deck. As he had guessed, some of the people
on board were in the cockpit enjoying the first
part of the evening.</p>

<p>“When’s the boss aimin’ to open up on
Nevens?” asked a harsh voice.</p>

<p>“Next Thursday at midnight!” some one said.</p>

<p>There was a mingling of voices for a minute or
two while the G-man’s son chuckled with delight
at his good fortune and the luck which had brought
the <i>Sea Hawk</i> into Zenith Harbor. Then some
one asked:</p>

<p>“Have a seat over here, Mr. Hegarty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Surely, surely. Splendid here, isn’t it, boys!”
a cultured voice answered. “Delightful coast,
this.”</p>

<p>“We got work ahead of us next week, I hear,
Boss.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Cowboy Nevada wants thirty per cent
or nothing doing. Robbery, I call it. Guess we
can take care of things without Cowboy. You
boys better oil up your guns. And keep sober.
I don’t want any drunken babbling.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! You bet!”</p>

<p>“We’re with you, Hegarty!”</p>

<p>There was more to it, and Stan gathered that
something of prime importance was to take place
Thursday at midnight, evidently a raid being
planned on Porpoise Island and the entrenched
Mr. Nevens!</p>

<p>“Cowboy’s got a new gunman,” said Hegarty’s
voice. “The name is Gallagher. Take particular
pains to remove Mr. Gallagher, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Gallagher!” thought Stan. Was it possible
that his father had already worked into that gang
as a gunman, just as he had done once before
with another gang during the Hogan case? He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
was not sure, but he had a hunch that that was
right, and if so he must warn Mr. Sandborn at
once!</p>

<p>Cold from his enforced loafing in the water,
Stan swam softly away now from the brightly
lighted <i>Sea Hawk</i> and, by a roundabout way,
swam back to the <i>Staghound</i>. He knew that John
was still off the bows of the big yacht, and he had
to let his chum know that it was time to return.
He lit the cabin lights and left the porthole curtains
drawn back. Then he got into warm, dry
clothes, slipped a sweater on, and went on deck.
In a short time he saw the dark blob of John’s
head and the glint of broken water as the rangy
lad came back to the <i>Staghound</i>.</p>

<p>“Schools of flying porpoises, and pods of gooseberries!”
cried John, shivering like a shaken tube
of jelly. “Why didn’t you go to bed and forget
me?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me it was cold out there, John, old
bean!”</p>

<p>“Cold?” breathed John, hurrying below. “It
was worse than that. I had to battle sharks to
keep warm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“There’s a fellow named ‘Gallagher’ now with
Nevens’ gang, John,” said Stan, “and I bet that’s
my Dad. Seems to me he mentioned that name
once the other night, and it would be just like him
to go to work for Mr. Nevens.”</p>

<p>Then he told John about Hegarty’s plan to raid
Nevens on Thursday at midnight with special
attention to the new gunman!</p>

<p>“That means we have to get all the evidence we
can before that, John,” Stan said, eagerly.
“Fingerprints, photos, and all, because after
Thursday it will be too late. The F. B. I. will
have to be sure of its ground and in action in time!
You and I had better get this cabin fixed up to-morrow
and get over to the Island pronto!”</p>

<p>They worked hard all the next morning hammering,
sawing, refitting moulding, putting in
the secret cupboard under a bunk, changing the
galley, and then repainting the whole thing with
quick-drying enamel. The painting was not done
till after dinner and they had to wait for it to dry.
The <i>Sea Hawk</i> was still in the harbor, and Stan
had an idea. It was daring and it might bring big
results. It was worth a try!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“The tender went ashore a few minutes ago,
John,” observed Stan. “What say if we hurry
over to the wharf, tie up there, and then follow
Hegarty and his men and try to get fingerprints!”</p>

<p>It was no trouble to hoist the sails and close in
with the pier, where they tied up and lowered sail.
Then they tucked fingerprint powders in small
envelopes into their pockets and took along a
magnifying glass each. They were afraid to take
along the new G-man camera which Mr. Sandborn
had given them to replace the broken one, for
fear Hegarty might recognize it as such.</p>

<p>They soon located the <i>Sea Hawk’s</i> head man in
a lunch room, and both boys sauntered in and
took a table near by. The conversation of Hegarty
and the two men with him was just about casual
things; and they drank beer and did not pay any
attention to the two boys.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Hegarty and his men
arose, paid the bill, and left, heading for the post
office. Stan and John got up too, paid their own
bill for a bottle of soda apiece and some doughnuts,
and then stepped over to the table just
vacated by the others. There was one beer bottle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
which had passed from hand to hand and this
Stanley longed to possess.</p>

<p>“Say,” said he to the owner of the restaurant
and beer parlor, “I’ll give you ten cents for that
bottle.”</p>

<p>Puzzled at such a proposition, for ten cents was
quite a price for an almost worthless bottle, the
man frowned. Before he could say anything,
however, John had tucked the bottle lightly under
one arm and Stan had laid ten cents upon the
table.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” said Stan.</p>

<p>“Sure, O.k.,” said the man, scratching his head
and wondering.</p>

<p>Outside, the boys ducked into an alley, where
powders were brought into play under expert,
youthful fingers. Then magnifying glasses were
brought to bear upon certain tell-tale smudges
upon the dark brown bottle.</p>

<p>“Beauties, John, honeys!” cried Stan with delight.</p>

<p>They had fingerprints of every man of the
three, including Hegarty!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER IX</small><br>

The G-Man Grocer Meets the
Boys</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Staghound</i> sailed away from the wharf
at Zenith Village a very few minutes after
the boy detectives had secured the fingerprints and
the beer bottle, wrapped lightly in cloth, had been
stored away in the secret compartment of the
sloop. They headed for the Lighthouse at once
while Stan looked up, on the chart, the compass
course for Porpoise Island.</p>

<p>Off the Lighthouse, as they trimmed the new
sails and bowled merrily along, they talked of
many things, chiefly of what lay ahead.</p>

<p>“I’m satisfied that Hegarty and his men did
not recognize us, Stan,” John said. “They could
only have had a look at us through binoculars in
the cove and hardly a good look at that! And
they paid no attention to us in the restaurant.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re right, John. At any rate we’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
on our way for Porpoise Island again and here’s
hoping we can get plenty of dope to salt away for
the F. B. I. The more I think about it the more
I am sure that ‘Gallagher’ is Dad and, if he is, we
ought to be able to help him some.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’ll give us clues to carry back to
Main Haven to that fellow ‘John’ that he spoke
of. Sweeping fields of delicious corn—I hope
luck is with us!”</p>

<p>Down along the southwestern horizon fog was
looming, distant but distinct, and the wind was
strong, raising good-sized rollers up the stretch of
the bay. The <i>Staghound</i> dipped her lee rail in
white water as she eased along with queenly grace,
and the boys were jubilant. Disguised in far
different clothes from their customary apparel,
and aboard a boat so disguised that it appeared
like an entirely new craft, they felt certain they
could get into the cove on the southwest part of
the island without trouble and do some scouting
ashore.</p>

<p>“Let’s hit for Main Haven first, Stan,” John
suggested, “and look up John. After all, we
ought to know him at least by sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“That’s all right with me, John, but I think we
ought to sail along the sea side of the island as we
go and perhaps we’ll pick up a clue or two while
passing.”</p>

<p>“O.k., Skipper!”</p>

<p>At the wheel John held the sloop closer to the
wind, laying a course to take them off the western
end of the island and round into the ocean side.
It was nearing dinner time and John was hollow
inside.</p>

<p>He was glad when Stan’s trick at the wheel
came round. Grinning, John went below to stir up
a meal. Shortly, the smell of hot coffee came up
from the cabin and snatches of song, mingled with
suspicious munching sounds. Stan chuckled. John
would have eaten in any kind of weather, at sea or
ashore, and alive or dying. Outside of sleuthing
the lanky one enjoyed eating best!</p>

<p>He brought coffee up to his friend and big club-sandwiches,
for Stan did not like to leave the
wheel with the new sail as yet not fully tested and
especially in the rather heavy waves making up
the bay.</p>

<p>They were thus engaged in sailing and eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
when the <i>Sea Hawk</i> hove into view astern, overhauling
them rapidly. John was sitting, facing
aft, and saw her first.</p>

<p>“Great heaps of dangle-berries!” said he.
“The <i>Sea Hawk</i> is after us! Let’s run off before
the wind!”</p>

<p>“Where you going to run to, John, under sail,
and against the power of that yacht?” queried
Stan, quietly. “And have you forgotten that we
are just a couple of boys out for pleasure?”</p>

<p>“You’re right! If we turn tail and run the <i>Sea
Hawk</i> would suppose us suspicious characters
providing anybody aboard suspected our identities.”</p>

<p>The white and fast yacht overtook the sloop
rapidly and both boys had sinking feelings in
their stomachs. John insisted on going below and
digging out their bows and arrows from a narrow
slit under the bunks and bringing them into the
cockpit. If the men on the <i>Sea Hawk</i> closed in
it would be a warm reception at any rate!</p>

<p>Closer and closer came the big craft but, as
she neared the sloop the <i>Sea Hawk</i> veered away
a little and then held her course again taking her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
across the bows of the sailing boat a hundred yards
distant. Hegarty, easily distinguished by his
height and build was standing on the bridge.</p>

<p>Stan took one hand from the wheel and waved
a greeting. Hegarty and another man nearby returned
the wave and shouted something which
could not be made out because of the distance.</p>

<p>“And that’s that, John!” grunted Stan, breathing
freely as the yacht drew off round the island.</p>

<p>It was Stan, facing forward, who first saw the
gray motorboat which came humming round the
island and began circling the <i>Sea Hawk</i>. The
binoculars showed a fat and dumpy fellow standing
in the rear cockpit of the speedboat.</p>

<p>Dago appeared to be shouting back and forth
at Hegarty and the <i>Sea Hawk</i> was moving slower
now while the gray boat circled about her. The
speedboat was making heavy weather of it, splashing
about in white water among the waves and
Dago appeared very angry. As the <i>Staghound</i>
began to overtake the white yacht, the gray boat
drew off and started down toward the sloop.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Stan, “will Dago know us in our
disguise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>It seemed more than likely that the strapping
henchman of Nevens would know them as the
two boys who had wounded him a few nights before
and whom he had encountered on the island
and they were not sure whether or not to let fly
with the arrows again before he could do anything,
or chance an interview. They had not long
to decide for the speedboat hummed and splashed
down towards them at a fast clip, and it was clear
that Dago was looking the sloop over with a
jaundiced eye.</p>

<p>Stan’s cap covered his yellow hair very well and
he had on a dark sweater and John was likewise
attired. Would Dago penetrate that mask? He
drove down towards them, looking hard at them
and they remained low in the cockpit, apparently
at ease—two boys having the time of their lives
sailing in the bay!</p>

<p>“Nice-a day, boys,” yelled Dago showing his
teeth.</p>

<p>“Yeh, swell, mister!” John rejoined, half
covering his face with a sandwich as he spoke.
John winked at Stan.</p>

<p>Stan, his mouth full of food which served to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
make his cheeks rounder than they really were,
waved to Dago. And the gray boat swept past, ran
once round the sloop, and went zipping back to
Porpoise Island around whose western end the
<i>Sea Hawk</i> had now disappeared. The fog was
closing up some, and the wind was rising.</p>

<p>They had gone through several tests successfully
and they were elated. The <i>Staghound</i>
curved round the end of the island, and the sheets
were eased for the run to Main Haven. Late in
the afternoon the white sloop rippled into the
quieter waters of Main Haven harbor and
up to the town pier where it tied up to the
wharf.</p>

<p>“Now, Mate,” said Stan, “we’ve got to find
your ‘namesake’!”</p>

<p>“I guess they picked a swell name for a G-man
when they chose mine,” said John, grinning.</p>

<p>They located the grocery store without undue
trouble and strolled in as casually as possible. As
they actually needed a few staples such as sugar,
butter, and bread, their manner was convincing.
A few customers were there but were shortly
waited on by the good-looking youngish man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
seemed to run the place and the boys were alone
with him.</p>

<p>He came towards them and offered to wait on
them.</p>

<p>Stan was thrilled. This was almost like some
of the detective stories he had read! And <i>this</i> was
real! Here was an actual Federal special agent
of the F. B. I. posing as a grocery man!</p>

<p>“Any idea who I am?” queried Stan, quietly.</p>

<p>The grocer began looking over his lettuce as if
picking one out for them.</p>

<p>“Who are you, then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The name’s ‘Sandborn’ and my friend is
‘Tallman.’”</p>

<p>The grocer handed Stan a lettuce head.</p>

<p>Outside, anyone would have supposed the conversation
to have been about that lettuce head.</p>

<p>“Any news, Sandborn?” asked John, softly.</p>

<p>“Nothing yet, John,” Stan said. “But we’re
going to the island to-night and hope to get something
in the way of clues. I suppose you’d call
fingerprints of Hegarty news, though——?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got Hegarty’s fingerprints, Sandborn?”
asked John, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“On a beer bottle. Shall I bring them in to
you?”</p>

<p>“You bet. Bring it back in one of these bags as
if it was some vegetables being returned. I’ll see
that it’s well taken care of.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and Hegarty is planning a raid on Porpoise
Island for Thursday at midnight, I believe.”</p>

<p>“And you said there was no news!” groaned
John. “Come on, now, before some one comes in,
let me have the whole story.”</p>

<p>They told the G-man everything they had
learned in the last twenty-four hours or so and he
seemed pleased.</p>

<p>“Now go back and keep up the good work and
we’ll have something to show for our round-up
of these criminals, boys,” said the man. “You’re
doing fine!”</p>

<p>They went back to the yacht and brought the
beer bottle, in a bag, to the store. Customers were
there as they entered.</p>

<p>“Say,” said Stan, abruptly, “that bunch of
carrots you just sold me wasn’t so hot, Mister.”</p>

<p>He handed John the bag. The G-man smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“All right. I’ll take it back gladly. Anything
you want in its place?”</p>

<p>Back again at the yacht, the boys hugged each
other with delight. Then they hauled up the sails
and started for Porpoise Island. They had to
tack back and forth a mile or so at a stretch to
reach the cove, and the last part of the way fog
threatened to close in any moment. Both boys
were glad when the anchor was dropped in South
Cove, on the western tip of the island. There
had been no sign of life on the island as they beat
down its shores and the fog was now rolling in
heavily.</p>

<p>They had supper, listening to the lonely drone
of fog signals from steamers out on the nearby
sea and the faint, faint echo of Zenith signal.</p>

<p>“A fine night for murder!” John commented,
glad of the lighted lamp and the table of good
things to eat. “If it weren’t necessary, I’d say
don’t go out—lie in our bunks and read! Pass
the cake, old boy, I’ve a little more room left
yet!”</p>

<p>The dishes washed and put away, they got out
the bows and arrows which had been returned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
the hiding place, adjusted flashlights, and dark
clothes, and made ready to go ashore.</p>

<p>“At a time like this, I wish we had a rowboat
to take us back and forth,” sighed John. “How’re
we going to get ashore in these togs without getting
soaked?”</p>

<p>It was Stan who had insisted on regular clothing
and now he explained that there was a natural
landing rock on the inner curve of the cove where
the <i>Staghound</i> could be moored. Stumpy cedar
trees would serve as mooring bitts and the boys
could step ashore dryly and quickly.</p>

<p>In the fog they had some difficulty finding the
spot, but they did in spite of fog and night and
moored the sloop securely. Then they stepped
ashore by way of the rocks and searched for the
end of the path which would lead inland to the lair
of the super-criminal, Nevens.</p>

<p>After overrunning the spot twice they found the
narrow cleft through thick bushes and were soon
padding softly uphill and along the ridge towards
their destination. They had to move slowly, feeling
their way along, for they dared not use the
lights without dire need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>An hour must have passed before Stan, in the
lead, pressed back a warning hand.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he cautioned.</p>

<p>Sounds of men’s voices drifted through the
black fog.</p>

<p>“The boss must be nuts, stringing us out on a
night like this, Butch!” said one voice. “Whose
gonna raid us in this kind of weather?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t nobody going to raid us, says I. Cowboy’s
scared Hegarty so much I guess we ain’t
likely to have no trouble.”</p>

<p>“And with Gallagher along, I guess we can
hold our own!” the first speaker said. “That guy’s
a honey with a tommy-gun!”</p>

<p>“His fists ain’t too bad, either, Butch,” some
third voice said.</p>

<p>“Say, Dago makes me laugh,” Butch commented.
“He’s scared stiff of them kids! You
know the ones I mean!”</p>

<p>“Sure the two what got their maps in the
paper!”</p>

<p>The voices were drawing near now and both
boys slipped back from the trail. Even as they
did so the men almost stumbled upon them and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
John lay prone at once, scared. Some one
stepped on his right hand, his flashlight blinked as
his squeezed fingers pressed the trigger and the
light flared its betrayal.</p>

<p>His yell of pain and the bright light came at
once!</p>

<p>“Run, John! Run!” yelled Stan and his feet
could be heard scurrying away.</p>

<p>Obeying, instinctively, John rolled to his feet,
thrashed off through the bushes and began to run.
Behind him came thundering feet, and shouting
voices. If the men had been surprised and startled
by the flare of light and John’s yell they had
soon gotten over that and had spread out to
capture the boys. John stumbled through bushes,
crashed headlong into a tree trunk, saw stars and
zooming comets flare through his mind, and went
sprawling backwards! Even as he fell and heard
the overtaking pursuers, he had a feeling all was
over!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER X</small><br>

Nevada’s Biggest Plot</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE fight between Dago and Gallagher was
one of the shortest fights Cowboy Nevada
had ever witnessed, for the G-man was strong,
capable, possessed of dynamite in either fist, and
showed a willingness to mix in. Neither the super-criminal
himself nor the swarthy henchman knew,
of course, that they had a man there trained for
just such emergencies. Cowboy only knew that
here was a man who could fight and was therefore
something to be desired as a personal bodyguard.
And Dago knew very little until he was brought
to by a pan of water expertly thrown upon him
by bland Wan Ho Din.</p>

<p>From the moment Cowboy had given the order
to “Get going!” Mr. Sandborn had waded in,
fencing through flailing arms as Dago strove to
knock him out, then, with the first hint of a good
opening, letting the surprised opponent have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
sound crack on the jaw which took lots of fight
out of him. Staggered, Dago blundered by trying
a hay-maker, and Gallagher let him have another
full on the jaw. Two of those punches were quite
enough and Dago collapsed.</p>

<p>“That was well done, Gallagher,” said Cowboy.
“A very neat job. Guess you better take
Dago’s place from now on. Unless—you ain’t
interested!”</p>

<p>“Take Dago’s place? Be the big shot next to
you, Nevada? Lead me to it!” Gallagher cried.
“Have you gotta comb? I mussed my hair. Don’t
generally have so much trouble with these tough
guys.”</p>

<p>Dago, silent and glaring, shook the water from
his head as a trace of a smile came over Wan Ho
Din’s face, and went off. That he would spare
no chance to even the score with Gallagher, none
there doubted.</p>

<p>Dinner was shortly to be served and, in the
dining room of the cabin, Gallagher was formally
introduced to some dozen men, mostly young men
hard of face and steely eyed and all inclined to
excessive cigarette smoking as if their nerves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
were constantly on edge. There were chairs set
for a dozen more at the long table though food was
not placed there.</p>

<p>“Some of the boys is away on business, Gallagher,”
explained Cowboy, indicating the empty
seats. “And some ain’t never going to be here
anymore. Them’s the ones that’s had—accidents——”</p>

<p>A particularly young man near the end of the
table rose to his feet with a grating laugh which
rose in crescendo and pitch as he stood now trembling
and white.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” said Cowboy; “you got nothing to
worry about, Gagnon.”</p>

<p>Gagnon turned staring eyes towards Cowboy.</p>

<p>“Nothing to worry about?” demanded Gagnon.
“With the Feds on our trails and the heat ready
to turn on? What about Hegarty? You——”</p>

<p>“Steady, Gagnon,” whispered the man next to
him.</p>

<p>“Steady? What for? I’m liable to get plugged
to-night for all I know. I’m——”</p>

<p>Then, something in Cowboy’s eyes conveying a
terrible warning, Gagnon seated himself, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
cigarette dropping from his fingers while he
buried his face in his hands. Mr. Sandborn had
a pretty good idea what the trouble was, in fact,
he was certain that he could piece together the
story back of Gagnon.</p>

<p>Gagnon was probably like thousands of others
buried in crime. Lured in his recent youth by
rich rewards that crime could offer, easy money,
and good times, he had first stolen odds and ends
to sell to some “fence” of the underworld, gone on
from that to spare-hand with a petty gang in an
easy robbery or two, proved himself nervy and
willing and been put “on the payroll” of the vast
syndicate headed by Cowboy. Being bright, good-looking, and
skillful with a gun, Gagnon had undoubtedly
worked his way from the bottom of
the syndicate ladder to his present spot at the
long table of a cabin on Porpoise Island.</p>

<p>He’d enjoyed good food, merry company, and
a carefree existence between the days of “work”
for this syndicate but he had not been happy.
Always he had to be battling the law and even
when the law had been tied by Cowboy’s money
and influence, there was always the chance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
G-man “heat.” He could not go out on a street
in any town or city without the chance of being
mowed down by rival gang-fire or being picked
up by some unbribed law agency. Not all the
easy money he had earned could give him peace
of mind, for his conscience troubled him, and a
thousand forms of death awaited their chance to
strike. Cowboy had lived to mature age, in spite
of a life of crime, but Cowboy had been extremely
lucky. Gagnon knew that nine out of ten of the
Gagnons in the crime world would be laid out on
cold marble slabs in morgues before they had
reached twenty-four! Gagnon was nearing that
age now though his years of crime had robbed his
eyes of their youth and left care and worry imprinted
there.</p>

<p>Now his nerve was snapping. He knew if it
gave way too much Cowboy would have him taken
for a little ride because the unfortunate Gagnons
of this world always “know too much!” And now
his nerve <i>had</i> snapped!—far enough to leave him
shaken to the core, nauseated——</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn was thinking fast, preparing for
a certain eventuality. Once before he had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
care of a gunman named Racira in a similar
case——</p>

<p>The talk at the table now began, a good deal of
serious discussion of ways and means to enlarge
the syndicate, and some nervous jokes. On the
whole these young men were far from carefree.
They lived, breathed and ate crime as it were, and
nothing is so luscious to look upon and so indigestible
as crime! If, like Gagnon, these others
realized how close their end was, they hid it well
from themselves and, especially, from Cowboy.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn learned a great deal of very
great value at that meal, things which would
spell the doom of the thing as soon as the G-man
could get his information out to the waiting Chief.
The little tricks, the petty schemes, and the underlying
rot of the system which Cowboy controlled
showed clearer and clearer. Here was a system
so thorough and so remorseless in its revenge upon
squealers that hardly a store or place of business
in the entire country was without a gambling
device (just within the law, yet drawing money
from fools who played the games), inferior manufactured
products selling under well-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
names, lotteries, “number games” and grosser
things. Then there was bank robbery to be run,
investment stunts, fake gold mines and other
mines—so many forms of illegal gathering of
money that the hardened G-man, veteran of war
against crime for many years, was appalled at the
power and ability of Cowboy Nevada. And what
stunned him most was the realization that the man
had his competitors, except for a few like
Hegarty, helpless or dead, and his ambition was
now driving him towards an inevitable goal, a goal
so immense that law and order hardly gave such
a scheme credence—a plan to overthrow the
government of these United States and place
Cowboy Nevada, ex-cowpuncher and bad-man,
as dictator of the lives and property of the
people!</p>

<p>After the meal Cowboy took his new right-hand
man all about the place, disclosing the fact that
the cove was surrounded by cleverly hidden
machine gun emplacements and the cabin was
a veritable arsenal and fort with metal-lined walls
and secret sally ports.</p>

<p>“About those kids you spoke of, Cowboy,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Gallagher said, “you ain’t really bothered about
them, are you? From what I hear that Hogan
case was a fluke. The kids happened to stumble
into it and the newspapers made more of it than
really was there. The Feds got the mobs, and the
boys was underfoot most of the time!”</p>

<p>Cowboy regarded Gallagher with a cold eye,
slyly.</p>

<p>“Kids can get underfoot till you break your
neck, Gallagher! They know too much already!
I’ve got men watching the houses now where they
live and every harbor for their boat. We’ll have
’em shortly and I aims fer you to take care of
them!”</p>

<p>“What you want done?”</p>

<p>“Wait till we get ’em and I’ll tell you!”</p>

<p>So things went till evening, Mr. Sandborn
learning all the ramifications of the stupendous
system by which Cowboy Nevada was taking toll
from the work of honest millions of people in the
country and yet, till darkness that day, the man
named “Gallagher” did not learn a word from
Cowboy about the real source of the vast hoard of
money by which the ex-western bad-man had got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
his start in the big-time rackets. It had taken a
big sum to go so fast through the underworld, resources
to be spent lavishly.</p>

<p>After supper that night Mr. Nevens took his
new man on a strange boat ride, from the boat-house
into the middle of Black Cove. A flat-bottomed
scow, which had lain inshore, half-hidden
by trees, now proved its usefulness. Anchored
at the cove’s center this scow served as the
landing platform from which interesting things
took place, as Stan and John had seen it used at
night. Mr. Sandborn acted very much surprised,
however, at what took place. A diver was soon
outfitted and sent down into the water, taking
with him an enormous and powerful underwater
light, special invention of the ingenious Mr.
Nevens. While he was down, for a period of a
half hour, the crime head told his story, a story
almost incredible.</p>

<p>And at the end of a half hour during which the
air pump had wheezed and men worked about the
decks, keeping all lines open and free, the diver
began his ascent. A little later, by the glare of a
light, Mr. Sandborn gazed down at the deck upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
a stout, heavy case. It bore, on the outside, the
name of a famous brand of liquor!</p>

<p>Could it be that a boat-load of liquor had been
the source of an income sufficient to set up Cowboy
Nevada in racketeering? Mr. Sandborn
looked at Nevada now and the glint in the man’s
eyes was cold, calculating, triumphant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XI</small><br>

Captured</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN John came to, he fully expected to
find himself held prisoner by none other
than Mr. Nevens himself. His surprise was the
more intense, as he shook his aching head and sat
up, to find that he was still in a fog; and it was not
a mental one either. All about him was dark
damp fog. He had escaped from their pursuers?
Yes, for there were no sounds save the rustling of
trees in the blackness. He started, all of a sudden,
shocked by the discovery that he had lost his bow
and quiver of arrows!</p>

<p>Knowing that they were his only weapon except
his wits in the present dilemma, he tried hard to
think of what had happened to them. He knew
that he’d left the yacht with them, stepping ashore
from the <i>Staghound</i> with them under one arm.
He’d have to find them, and soon! Then he had
a flash of remembrance that, as Stan shouted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
them to run, he’d felt his bow and arrows yanked
from his grip as he dashed through the bushes.
If some one of the pursuing men had grabbed
them, that party might be waiting now for him
to go back to search for them. He had to chance
that likelihood.</p>

<p>So he went back as near as he could guess to the
spot from which the chase had begun, wondering
as he did so about a lot of things. Where was
Stan? What was Mr. Sandborn doing? He had
retraced his steps as best he could and was searching
about among the bushes, as quietly as possible,
when he ran into something which struck him in
the chest! It felt like the end of a gun barrel, and
John Tallman thought that the worst had happened!</p>

<p>But no challenge came with that touch, and
gently he slid one hand to the object. A little cry
of joy escaped his lips as he recognized his bow’s
end! It was caught in a bush, and the catching
of the string had simulated a yank at the time he’d
run. He released it, and found on the ground the
quiver with the arrows. Grateful for his good
luck, he listened, hearing footsteps approaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Then came voices, men’s voices.</p>

<p>“Where do you s’pose that other kid got to,
Dago?” some one was asking.</p>

<p>Dago’s reply was mingled with profanity as
the men came down a path and passed by the spot
where John was crouching, ears straining for
every word. As the men went on, the lad arose
and followed them, stepping softly and listening
to a great many interesting things.</p>

<p>“Well, we got the other kid, anyhow, Dago.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, and we’ll get-a the dark-haired one, too,
before the night’s over. Nevada’s sure glad!”</p>

<p>“Gallagher didn’t seem so happy, somehow,
Dago,” said a voice.</p>

<p>Dago swore.</p>

<p>“Gallagher ain’t——”</p>

<p>“Ain’t what, Dago?”</p>

<p>“Youse guys ull tell Nevada if I tells ya what
I thinks, so I’m keeping mum.”</p>

<p>“Trouble with you, Dago, is, you ain’t a good
loser!” chuckled the first man. “He licked you
with the rods, licked you with his fists, and his
brain’s just ’bout eight times your size brain,
stupid!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“What’s the use of hanging round here all
night, Dago,” some one else wanted to know. “We
can’t see the other kid in the dark. We ain’t cats,
ya know!”</p>

<p>“Well, if them kids is here, they got-a boat,
ain’t they? And if they got-a boat, we’ll find it
to-morrow, by thunder. I knows her when I
sees her. Black she is, with one of them ‘gaff’
rigs.”</p>

<p>“I hear you left your gloves on her last time,
Dago!” chaffed the first speaker.</p>

<p>“I hears you ain’t gonna be healthy long, if
you keep-a yapping at me, Butch!” growled
Dago.</p>

<p>John Tallman was so interested in what was
being said that he came within an inch of colliding
with the last man of the bunch as they slowed
up and stopped. Some sixth sense warned him,
and he stopped and listened. He heard bushes
rustling, something metallic clanking softly, and
then came a noise of men on wooden steps! In a
moment the party had disappeared, leaving John
Tallman, puzzled and annoyed, standing in the
fog alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>His back running gooseflesh, he pressed slowly
and carefully forward, and touched—a door! Investigation
with careful finger tips proved it to
be a small oblong door of metal without any
handle or latch. That it went into an underground
tunnel he knew, for the steps had sounded
“down,” not up, and besides, as John guessed, the
island was a maze of secret passages. How near
to the cabin they were, in fact in which direction
they had been moving, he had no idea. But he had
to find out, because until something turned up,
he’d have to follow every clue to find Stanley and
try to rescue him.</p>

<p>What lay beyond that door? And how could
he get it open? He had no answer to either question,
but he had to find some way to get in and
discover for himself the answer to the first. Again
he ran his fingers over the door, particularly on
the side away from the hinges; then he tried pressing
in that area and was abruptly rewarded by
feeling a tiny square of metal go in under his
fingers, and at once the door swung inward!</p>

<p>Darkness as dark as the outside still was there
before his eyes, and he stepped forward gingerly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Down several wooden steps he felt his way, stumbled
into the wall, and found that the passage now
went sharply away to the right. He went along,
guiding himself by one hand against a wall, feeling
for each of the upright timbers supporting
the walls and roof of the tunnel. The air was close
and damp, and smelled strongly of sour earth.</p>

<p>How far he went in this manner he was not sure,
possibly about one hundred yards without an
apparent turn in the tunnel, and then it swung
left sharply and went downhill to a slight rate of
drop. Faint light showed far ahead, though the
distance could not have been above fifty yards
further, ending in another curve. There were
side aisles now to be dimly seen due to the vague
reflection of the lights, and this was extremely
fortunate for John Tallman, for he heard footsteps
and had barely time to retreat to a side
aisle and set an arrow to the notch, when the men
approached.</p>

<p>“The kid will be all right with Gagnon,” said
Dago, passing down the main tunnel.</p>

<p>“Yeh, he’s that nervous he’d choke the kid
if the guy lets a peep out of him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“And ain’t that just about what Nevada
wants?”</p>

<p>“Just about. Only he aims to have this Gallagher
guy take care of the rub-out!”</p>

<p>“I still don’t-a like the looks of Gallagher,”
Dago said. “Nevada’s a fool-a to be taken in by
the guy. How do we know he ain’t a Fed in disguise?”</p>

<p>A burst of raucous laughter resounded down
the tunnel at that, and Butch roared, “You been
readin’ these G-man mags, Dago, old rat!”</p>

<p>“I been readin’ about-a that Hogan case, you
mean. They say they was a G-man what was a
spy fer one of the gangs!”</p>

<p>“Worked right in with them, Dago?”</p>

<p>“Right-hand man!”</p>

<p>There was silence as they hurried away; then
some one grunted, “Something to think about,
anyhow; eh?”</p>

<p>But John Tallman had heard enough to make
his hopes rise as well as fall. He knew that
Gallagher was probably Mr. Sandborn and that
he was in grave danger because these men would
stop at little to discover his real identity, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
felt elated, because what had been said must mean
that Stanley Sandborn was not far distant!</p>

<p>Excited, he shoved off towards the lights again,
hurrying along now that he could see, ready to
dart into a side aisle at the first need.</p>

<p>He rounded a bend in the tunnel faster than he
planned and was through a door and into a small
room before he realized what had happened!
There <i>he</i> was and there was—Stanley, with a
youngish mobster! Stan was tied with his hands
behind him, and the gangster had a drawn automatic
on a convenient table. The man, probably
the Gagnon Dago had mentioned, went for the
gun, but John had an arrow drawn back to the
tip!</p>

<p>“Leave it alone!” ordered John, aiming for the
man’s right arm.</p>

<p>But the hand was streaking for that gun and
did not stop. His fingers closed over the weapon
and he was drawing it back when the arrow
twanged home! With a startled outcry of pain
the man dropped the weapon, and grabbed for his
arm with his left hand.</p>

<p>The arrow had punctured one of the muscles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
and John covered the man with another arrow
as Gagnon pulled the first one free of the wound.
Being a muscle wound and the arrow having
missed any arteries or veins, it hardly bled any,
but was painful. The man turned a white face,
almost chalklike, towards the youth.</p>

<p>“Give me your knife, and fast!” ordered John.</p>

<p>The man reached awkwardly for his pocket and
drew out a knife. He opened it on order, wincing
from the pain of his wounded arm, and cut Stanley’s
ropes.</p>

<p>Stan’s bows and arrows were standing in the
corner of that room and the G-man’s son, rubbing
his arms quickly to restore the circulation, was
shortly standing with drawn bow beside John.</p>

<p>“Tie him up, John, while I cover his face with
this hunting arrow!”</p>

<p>Now, like most other young men, especially of
his type, Gagnon was particularly anxious to
keep his good looks, and the sight of that steel
point robbed him of any desire to resist the ropes
with which John now tied his wrists. And Gagnon
was thinking fast. He voiced his thought in
a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Listen, fellows,” said he, trembling, “I can’t
let Dago and the others find me like this!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked John, scornfully.</p>

<p>The man shivered, and his face seemed even
whiter.</p>

<p>“They would think I released you and then
let you tie me because I wanted you to get away!”</p>

<p>“You’d be on a spot, then; eh, Mr.—Gagnon!”</p>

<p>“How’d you know my name?”</p>

<p>“Had an idea,” admitted John, withholding
the source of that information.</p>

<p>“They’d kill me, boys!” cried the excited and
scared gangster.</p>

<p>About that time Dago and his men had emerged
from the tunnel and followed a path in the fog to
the boat-shed. There they were received in the
lighted interior by Nevada and Gallagher.</p>

<p>“We got the yellow-haired kid safely enough.
We took him to the ‘waiting room’ and left him
with Gagnon. And——”</p>

<p>“Is he there now?” demanded Nevada, sharply.</p>

<p>“Sure. We looked for the other kid and
couldn’t find him, and then went back to see that
Gagnon and the kid was o.k.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Gallagher, I guess you can take over the job
now. The other kid must be on the Island somewheres.
They probably landed from that black
sloop of theirs. We’ll have the Island circled
from daybreak by our runabouts and nab that
boat wherever it is. In the meantime we’ll get
the dark-haired Tallman kid. You do what you
think best with the Sandborn kid. You kin get
rid of him now or——”</p>

<p>“I’ll rub ’em both out to onc’t, Cowboy!” said
Gallagher, wiping his lips with his dry tongue.
“It’s like drowning kittens, ya know. I’ll take
’em both to onc’t, like I said!”</p>

<p>“Get going, then.”</p>

<p>Sullenly Dago led the new trigger-man up the
path to the tunnel entrance. Mr. Sandborn knew
that this tunnel ended in the “waiting room,”
where a party of heavily armed mobsters could
wait in safety till such time as their presence was
needed to counter attack any gang circling the
main system of tunnels about the cabin. In time,
Nevada planned to have tunnel connections from
the cabin to the waiting room, but in the meantime
it was isolated. The G-man was not unduly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
nervous at what lay ahead, for he had no intention
of course of letting harm come to either John or
his own son, Stanley. He only hoped now that
Stan would not give away the G-man’s identity
by any unexpected outburst of emotion.</p>

<p>“The kid’s pretty scared, Gallagher,” Dago
said. “I don’t-a envy you none!”</p>

<p>“Probably ain’t half as scared as you are of him,
Dago!” chuckled Gallagher.</p>

<p>Butch roared at that.</p>

<p>“The kid’s o.k., Gallagher. It’s Dago what’s
scared like a hen on a railway crossing! Arrows
ain’t so hot, be they, Dago?”</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Dago, displaying a flashlight
now which illuminated the door while he
opened it to the passage. They went down and
along the way to the room. The lights at the
other end glimmered round the corner. There
was a rustle in a side aisle!</p>

<p>“What was that?” demanded Dago.</p>

<p>Butch roared again.</p>

<p>“Them kids with their little bows and arrows,
probably!” cried Butch, hugging himself with
amusement, “Run, Dago, run!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Beefy faced and purple with anger, Dago put
back his weapon, and they went on to the room,
rounding the corner and going through the door.</p>

<p>“Suffering tripe!” cried Dago.</p>

<p>“Wow!” bellowed Butch.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn smiled.</p>

<p>“Gone!” said he, quietly.</p>

<p>“Gone?” demanded Dago as if he doubted his
own eyes. “Gone? How? Where? What about
Gagnon?”</p>

Delivering the Prisoner</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF EVER two boys undertook a desperate errand
the sandy-haired G-man’s son and his
pal had bitten off a big chunk to chew when Stan
proposed that they take Gagnon to Main Haven
and turn him over to John. What John might
do, Stan did not know but he realized that G-men
are extremely resourceful and he had no
doubt that the grocer of Main Haven would find
a way to take care of Gagnon till this case was
over. The most important immediate act was to
get Gagnon out of that little room, and to the
sloop.</p>

<p>“You mean you’re going to turn me over to the
feds?” demanded the mobster.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“They’ll kill me!”</p>

<p>“Battling flea-hounds!” roared John, interrupting,
“which do you want: to be murdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
by your dear old pals or to end up in a nice warm
jail, alive and with something to eat for the next
dozen years or more?”</p>

<p>The man swallowed hard.</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you, boys, only don’t point that
arrow at my face all the time!” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ve got sense!” responded Stan, quietly.
“Get a move on, and no funny business!”</p>

<p>And as the man started off up the corridor,
his hands bound behind his back, he admitted
that he had a flashlight in his pocket. John dug
it out and they hurried for the entrance. But
on the way they encountered the sounds of footsteps
and the voices of intruders and they retired
up a side aisle.</p>

<p>Dago’s exclamation of alarm was caused by
Gagnon’s stumbling effort to move further from
the main aisle as he recognized the swarthy fellow’s
growling voice. Had Dago elected to investigate
that noise he would have received an
arrow for his pains—lucky Dago!</p>

<p>The party went on to the room and, the moment
they had gone there, the boys rushed Gagnon
for the entrance! It was now or never. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
outcry of voices in the room back there drowned
out the hurrying footsteps of the lads and their
prisoner. Gagnon was no trouble. He was as
anxious to get away now as were the boys to
have him and he voluntarily took them away from
the entrance and on the trail towards the cove
where the boat was moored as he had been told
they would go over the hilltop trail to the western
end of the island. They doused the flashlight, of
course, and apprehensively followed the hurrying
prisoner through the black fog. It was an
eerie journey and towards the end Stan took the
lead as he knew just where the boat was. The
trail seemed somewhat unfamiliar as he neared
the end but he laid that feeling to the darkness and
hurried on.</p>

<p>They came out upon the beach and he went to
the right, leading Gagnon by the arm so that he
would not lose contact with him.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, boy,” said Gagnon; “I ain’t
gonna skip. I’d rather live in a fed jail than get
burnt with slugs!”</p>

<p>An astonished outcry from Stan was the first
warning that all was not well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“The sloop—gone!” cried Stan.</p>

<p>John groaned.</p>

<p>“By all the bluefish ankles in this—where?”
John begged.</p>

<p>The sloop was gone and that was that!</p>

<p>They had to put the flashlight on and then
Stan gave a hopeful exclamation.</p>

<p>“Say, this isn’t the rock where the <i>Staghound</i>
was moored! Maybe——”</p>

<p>“Maybe this isn’t the right cove!” cried John.</p>

<p>Investigation by the light of the flashlight
and lots of walking along the fog-bound shore
gave forth the astonishing fact that it was not the
cove where the sloop had lain!</p>

<p>“There were several coves around here, John,”
admitted Stan, “but how we got off the main trail,
I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Sweet potatoes!” moaned John. “We get us
a prisoner, and then lose our ship! A fine pair of
dicks we are! Are we south or north of our cove?”</p>

<p>“North, no doubt. We’ll go along shore.”</p>

<p>“Hurry!” begged Gagnon.</p>

<p>John was heard to chuckle aloud.</p>

<p>“<i>Hurry!</i>” he echoed. “Great spirits of bulrushes—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
you going to hurry through this
fog?”</p>

<p>But they did hurry as best they could and after
almost a half hour of scrambling along the beach
half in the water and half out, daring not to use
the light more than necessary, and falling over
rocks, they all three fell sprawling over something
taut! It was the spare line which Stan had rigged
from the bitt of the sloop over the rock to another
pointed boulder.</p>

<p>Gratefully, tingling with joy, the boys shoved
Gagnon aboard and went below to light their
lights. The cabin showed no signs of having been
entered and they were glad of that. In the light
of the cabin they made Gagnon lie on a bunk while
they got their brains working.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get out of this cove right off,
John!” Stan explained. “No time to lose and—”</p>

<p>“—The tide, Stan!”</p>

<p>“The tide is o.k., dropping towards low, but
still high enough to float us out into the cove
where we can lower our centerboard! Main thing
is—where’s the cove entrance?”</p>

<p>“Here’s your chart!” said John, putting it on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the table and handing the skipper a pencil. “I’ll
get the sails up and ready and the lines aboard.”</p>

<p>“O.k.,” said Stan, even as he started studying
the chart and laying a compass course that would
clear the rocks at the cove’s entrance. “Let her
drift away from the rock so we can get the centerboard
down to stop sideways.”</p>

<p>The tall youth was on deck by now and raising
the sails. He was grateful for the Marconi rig
now, for the mainsail was up by pulling one line
instead of the two required for the old rig. There
was one jib to raise instead of two. The sails
were up in a minute or two and he was ashore releasing
the lines holding her to the big rock.
Luckily the cove had been very quiet and the
single old tire used as a buffer between the <i>Staghound</i>
and the rock had kept the sloop from damage
by chafing.</p>

<p>The boat drifted away from the rock with the
tide and a vagrant puff or two of wind, while John
slacked the sheets so that the sails were not curved
yet to the breeze. He lit the little electric light
in the binnacle and studied the compass as it
swung slowly while the boat drifted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Steer W.S.W. a bit to the south, John,” came
Stan’s voice.</p>

<p>“Hey, you kids!” came a raucous and cursing
voice out of the dark. “Stop, do you hear, or we’ll
slug you plenty!”</p>

<p>In the cabin of the <i>Staghound</i> a trembling
gangster opened his mouth in terror. Stan knew
that Gagnon was about to scream for help on the
theory that, when captured, his friends would
think he’d been carried away forcibly! But the
skipper of the <i>Staghound</i> gagged the prisoner
instantly with a length of towel!</p>

<p>“Can’t hear you!” yelled John, and he trimmed
the sheets of the sloop!</p>

<p>Then a voice which was none other than Mr.
Sandborn’s bellowed, “You kids better come
back here. You’ll get slugged if you don’t! We
ain’t fooling!”</p>

<p>Did Mr. Sandborn mean for them to really surrender?
Or was he <i>bluffing</i> to convince the other
men. John knew no answer, and Stan, who came
on deck just then, was hesitant.</p>

<p>A blast of tommy-gun fire, familiar thunder to
the boys who had heard those guns used at Cedar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Island in the Hogan case, reverberated among the
hills! Water spattered about the sloop and slugs
sang whining into the wake! Then the blast
moved away to the left! It have been lucky shooting
for the men could not have seen the sloop in
the fog!</p>

<p>That decided the boys and with all sail crowded
on, praying that the compass course was right,
they headed on a course W.S.W. a little south!
The wind had shifted to the east during the night
and was almost dead aft, flowing over the hills of
Porpoise Island, as they coursed with wings
spread for the open sea!</p>

<p>“I told-a you they was-a at one of these coves!”
yelled Dago back on the beach. “Gallagher, you
gotta get those kids or we’ll all be in trouble!”</p>

<p>“Let’s get back and use the speedboats, men!”
ordered Gallagher, rejoicing inwardly that his
boy and the brave Tallman lad had escaped this
present danger and taken Gagnon with them!
He suspected they would head for Main Haven
and he was proud of them for their grit and brains.
Such conduct was worthy of G-men themselves!</p>

<p>The gangsters raced overland to the cabin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the boat-shed where, roundly cursed by a wild and
purplish Nevada, the men put off in two gray
speedboats on a weird chase! Mr. Sandborn
longed for a chance to get at the wiring on those
two boats and so stop the chase but realized it
might look suspicious and end his activities. So
he calmly took his seat with Butch and Dago in a
boat and they hummed with bright lights for the
entrance to Black Cove. They came out of that
in the wet fog at forty miles an hour, thankful for
sound knowledge of the lay-out of rocks and headlands.</p>

<p>One boat turned east, round the snout of Porpoise
Island and down the north coast. The other
flung itself into the rollers of the sea down the
southern side. Both boats traveled at top speed
but the fog ruined any chance of overtaking the
fleet sloop which was somewhere out there, silently
winging its way with a mobster prisoner!
Naturally the boys were not showing any side-lights
and thus, even without the fog, as Dago
well knew from past experience, it would have
been hard to locate and get them. Then, too, as
Dago admitted privately to himself—the boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
were pretty nifty with them arrow things!</p>

<p>They did have a chance, just one slim possibility
of finding that sloop, but only the G-man saw it
and he said nothing. For one instant, they were
running by the close stern of a white sloop, for he
saw both a faint shape of the sloop and the glitter
of white water from her wake as she capped a big
roller, but the light from the searchlight was being
flung straight ahead and no one else knew that
two boys had definitely escaped their pursuers!</p>

<p>About ten minutes later the light glittered
softly through the fog upon a sail and, with a
coarse exclamation of delight, Dago had Butch
swing to the boat. The cursing, shouting speedboat’s
crew slid alongside, and aboard, guns out
and hands ready!</p>

<p>“What is this?” demanded a big sailor in blue
at the wheel of the great forty-meter yacht.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>One look was sufficient to establish the fact that
a mistake had been made! Mr. Sandborn wanted
to laugh out loud, but couldn’t. He kept a firm
mouth while a flustered Dago did some quick explaining
to the bulging sailor at the wheel. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
below came a stern-faced man in a robe. He had
a shiny object in his right hand.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” demanded he, sharply.</p>

<p>“Looks like pirates, sir!” shot back the helmsman
who had not been fooled by Dago’s stuttered
apologies.</p>

<p>“Pirates?” demanded the owner. “Let me at
them!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At that moment, not a mile away in the wind-blown
waters of the ocean, a Marconi-rigged sloop
was racing through the fog on a compass course
of S.E. at her best gait, taking the rollers in her
stride, while her mast strained and her rigging
hummed! The fog seemed clear as they neared
Main Haven and soon they could make out the
cottages along the shore, and then the town itself.
It was starlit in that harbor as they drove in,
lighting side-lights as they came.</p>

<p>“There’s an abandoned wharf on the shore over
there,” Stan said, pointing to one side of the entrance.
“We’ll tie up there and walk Gagnon
round to the town. That way, we may keep our
identity hid, John!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“You’re right! Somebody’ll have to buy me
more arrows when this case is over—if Gagnon
tries any stunts!”</p>

<p>But Gagnon, who had heard that remark, did
not mean to try any stunts now that his deliverance
was near, and he meekly climbed ashore from
the wharf and marched ahead of the boys towards
town. They both had their bows along but, to a
casual observer, they having untied his hands, Mr.
Gagnon appeared like an older brother, hiking
into town with his two kid-brothers after a bow-and-arrow
hike.</p>

<p>Gagnon was as good as his word and they made
town in good shape and walked right into John’s
store! The grocer was just going to close up, for
it was very late.</p>

<p>“Sorry, boys, too late for groceries,” grinned
John.</p>

<p>“Too late for a prisoner, too?” demanded John
Tallman.</p>

<p>Now the Federal agent, John, had never realized
how really effective these two boys were before.
He’d laid their supposed prowess to newspaper
accounts and Mr. Sandborn’s praise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
fatherly affection for Stan and friendly regard
for the Tallman boy. But he had to think fast in
the next ten minutes or the whole town would
know something was wrong down at the grocery
store!</p>

<p>He whisked Gagnon into the cellar, bound and
gagged him and then went to the phone. He
called a number and said, “Hello, Jim, old boy?”</p>

<p>“Why, hello, John!” came the rejoinder.
“How’s the grocery business?”</p>

<p>“Pretty swell. How about coming down—over
the week-end with your bags?”</p>

<p>A whistle of surprise came over the wire.</p>

<p>“Like that, eh? I’ll drop in, old boy!”</p>

<p>And that meant that Mr. Gagnon would
shortly be in the hands of a squad of G-men and
that that same squad would make a net about
Porpoise Island, by land and sea, ready for the
big showdown on Thursday next!</p>

<p>“I’m hungry, Stan,” confessed John, as they
started back for the yacht. “What I mean is—I’m
actually HUNGRY!”</p>

<p>Stan didn’t seem surprised.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XIII</small><br>

Hegarty Plans a Surprise</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS a tired and hungry duet of detectives
who walked down the rickety old wharf about
midnight and climbed aboard the good sloop
<i>Water Witch</i> now masquerading as a Marconi
sloop called <i>Staghound</i>! Not too tired, however,
for John to go right to the stove and light the
burners. He had hot coffee ready while he discussed
the evening’s events with Stan.</p>

<p>“Stuffed alligator skins,” said John. “Gagnon
was one scared man.”</p>

<p>“Tried to yell for help when Dago and Dad
came down to the cove, though,” said Stan. “Figured
he might be better off with his old pals!”</p>

<p>“Where will they take him now, Stan, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>“For one thing, the newspapers won’t hear
about the capture of Gagnon, I bet. Dad and
the F. B. I. had a tough time keeping it secret that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
my father was a G-man in the Hogan case. If
they hadn’t succeeded, everyone would know
that Dad was a Special Agent and it would have
spoiled his future work. The day gangland gets
his photo to compare with the G-man who broke
the Hogan case they’ll get Dad on a spot, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right. I remember, speaking of
Gagnon again, that they spirited Racira away in
the Hogan affair, and I guess the mobsters will be
astonished when he appears in court as a witness
against them!”</p>

<p>“No more surprised than Nevada will be when
the F. B. I. gets Gagnon into the courtroom.
While Nevada will have an idea Gagnon is definitely
in Federal hands, he won’t expect his
former friend to testify against him.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think Gagnon will?”</p>

<p>“Simple. Gagnon’s lost his nerve. Gone yellow.
And there isn’t anything easier to get information
from than a gangster who turns yellow.
Dad says the mobsters have a saying that ‘A
canary sure can sing!’ That simply means a
scared prisoner will tell all if he once gets started.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“About our plans, Stan, what’ll we do now?”</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll follow John’s advice, and stay
away from Porpoise Island till Monday. The
big blow-off is to be Thursday at midnight. That
would give us from Monday till Thursday to complete
our work.”</p>

<p>John Tallman bit into a big slice of bread and
poured the coffee.</p>

<p>“Think Zenith Point Village would be safe for
us? I guess our disguise of the boat is all right,
don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Sure and besides, I figure, we ought to buy a
very small rowboat, round-bottomed, to carry on
the <i>Staghound</i>—I’m tired of mooring to piers and
rocks!”</p>

<p>“Swell. Oh, a home on the ocean blue—say,
bread tastes good, doesn’t it, when you’re
hungry?”</p>

<p>“It sure does!” admitted Stan, helping himself
to another piece. “Now, after we’ve been at
Zenith, a day or so taking us to Monday, we’ll get
back to Porpoise under cover of darkness and
hide ashore till daybreak. Then we’ll go after
the fingerprints and photos Dad suggested we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
get! Maybe we can get a chance to talk to him,
too!”</p>

<p>They were glad enough to get to sleep till early
morning. Before daybreak, however, they were
up and under way for Zenith Village. They kept
rather clear of Porpoise Island en route, for the
fog had lifted way past there and Zenith Light
was visible down the coast. They did not want to
run into any cruising gray speedboats just yet!</p>

<p>Daybreak had come and the sun was rising
higher and warmer when they laid the final tack
for Zenith Point Light. They rounded the light
and went on to the Village pier at once.</p>

<p>At the village they located just the type of
tender they desired in a local boat yard, bought it
for a price, and towed her out to the anchorage.
That morning, at their anchorage, they caught
up on much needed sleep and were not up and
about again till late afternoon.</p>

<p>There were several yachts in the harbor as usual
but none that they recognized. It proved difficult
to kill time during the next couple of days
but they had to do so if they were to follow their
plans. Between reading below decks or lolling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
in the sunshine, well down in the cockpit, and
burning the night oil over charts and plans, they
managed to watch the hours pass by. Once or
twice John hinted at fishing but they dared not
risk it on the chance that one of Nevada’s boats
might come up to inspect them. Ashore or in the
sloop they could duck from sight in such an event,
but the little rowboat would hardly serve as a
hiding place!</p>

<p>Monday morning was to be the beginning of big
things again and it started with a bang!</p>

<p>“Whoops!” cried John as he emerged from the
cabin into a cool morning. “Look who’s here—our
old playmate!”</p>

<p>The <i>Sea Hawk</i> had come in during the night
and was anchored across the harbor. And Stan
blinked his eyes—for the familiar outlines of the
yacht enclosed a black hull this time!</p>

<p>“Somebody else playing at disguise, John!”</p>

<p>“Yeh, the copy-cats! As if you wouldn’t
know that craft anywhere by the shape of her hull
and upper structure!”</p>

<p>“But you can’t see black as far at night as you
can white,” Stan pointed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>John gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“That’s right—Thursday—at <i>midnight</i>!”</p>

<p>“You’d think, Stan, that if any law officer
wanted to nip Hegarty, say on his yacht, it would
be easy. All they’d have to do would be look
up the registry of the boat and see for themselves
the owner’s name!”</p>

<p>“Chances are ten to one, Hegarty’s name on
the register is spelled quite different——”</p>

<p>“Ears of bantam corn—look!”</p>

<p>Another craft, newly painted in shiny black,
had just rounded the point and was moving over
towards the <i>Sea Hawk</i>! Low, fast-appearing,
the strange yacht was of cabin type, like many
other craft of her kind, but to the boys, her appearance
at that spot and at that time, spelled
more trouble! They could not be far wrong for,
before she had come completely at rest with her
anchor down, a boat was seen to row off from her
to the bigger craft.</p>

<p>“Me for my binoculars!” cried Stan, and
pounced below.</p>

<p>Afterwards, from low in the cockpit, he
reported that he could see activity on the deck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of the <i>Sea Hawk</i>—men moving about and all
seeming to talk with their hands! An argument
seemed in progress but it apparently ended amicably,
for everyone shook hands and the rowboat
went back to the newer boat.</p>

<p>“What’s the name of that boat, Stan?” John
asked.</p>

<p>The G-man’s son hesitated a moment then said,
“Looks like—‘<i>Malcon</i>’ to me, John.”</p>

<p>They made notes of these things with the time
and place, and Stan expressed a desire to get
photos of both boats. They took along their
camera, climbed into the tender and pushed off
as if for a row about the harbor. They took several
pictures of yachts as if on a picture-taking
trip and then drew into position for photos of the
<i>Sea Hawk</i>. Casually and without hurry, Stan
stood up and took two excellent photos.</p>

<p>“Two shots left, John,” he said, jubilantly,
“Now for the <i>Malcon</i>!”</p>

<p>Both boys were so eager to get the pictures that
they did not observe the fact that a tender pushed
off from the <i>Sea Hawk</i> and rowed over towards
them. In fact, they were startled to look up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
see the boat so close. Two seamen were in it.</p>

<p>“Hello, boys,” said one, a stocky, yellow-haired
fellow with a grinning ape face.</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Taking pictures, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure, we want them for a collection of swell
yachts in our albums,” Stan explained, and he
contrived to maneuver the camera to the floor
between his feet. He was bent over now.</p>

<p>“What kind of camera you got?” queried the
sailor. “I’m sorta nuts on cameras.”</p>

<p>“He sure is,” agreed the second sailor, a thin,
emaciated type. “Nuts is right.”</p>

<p>They both laughed as if at a secret joke then.</p>

<p>“Regular folding type,” Stan said. “Rectilinear
lens, speeds up to one-hundredth of a second.
Like to see it?”</p>

<p>That seemed to startle them and they nodded.
Stan handed the big fellow the camera as the two
boats closed together. As he did so the camera
slipped from his hands and went overboard!
Naturally Stan and the sailor reached for it too
late.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” said the seaman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“Ya gotta get it, thick-head!” yelled the thin
one.</p>

<p>“How kin I, I asks ya?” demanded the yellow-haired
fellow, exasperated. “Be careful!”</p>

<p>John was, naturally, down in the mouth, and
Stan appeared also to be downcast.</p>

<p>“Too bad, kid!” said the big chap, and the boat
drew off for the <i>Sea Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>Stan and John began to row to their own craft
as rapidly as possible without appearing in too
great a hurry.</p>

<p>“Did you really drop it, Stan?” demanded
John.</p>

<p>Stan grinned as if well pleased with himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later!”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time there was a very dumb,
dumb boy,” began John, as they climbed aboard
their boat and went to the cabin. “So dumb that
cameras meant nothing in his young life! Phff—what
was an expensive camera to him?”</p>

<p>“Listen and listen hard, John,” Stan said;
“we’re playing a dangerous game for big stakes!
A fifteen dollar camera is not to be considered as
valuable compared to the films I have!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Films? Why they went to the bottom of the
deep blue sea——”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! Here is the film!”</p>

<p>He showed the roll to his wondering chum and
explained that when the men rowed over he had
an idea that Hegarty suspected him and John
and had sent for the film. Probably the men had
been instructed to get the film. By being willing
to let them take the camera for inspection Stan
had thrown off suspicion. He was able to remove
the film before giving the camera to the sailor, and
knew that the empty camera would be prima facie
evidence of guilt, so made sure the instrument
went overboard!</p>

<p>Back on the <i>Sea Hawk</i> the two seamen stood
“on the carpet” in fact and in figure. Hegarty
was in a nasty mood.</p>

<p>“You going to stand there and tell me that kid
handed you the camera and you dropped it?”</p>

<p>“Well it was this way, Boss——”</p>

<p>Hegarty fixed them with a stare.</p>

<p>“The chances are that those kids are all right.
Just the same, we’re playing for big stakes. Nevada’s
got a fortune on that island and a racket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
system that’s worth billions! We can’t take
chances and we can’t afford to arouse suspicion.
It’s a toss up whether them kids was——”</p>

<p>“You’re nervous, boss,” said the yellow-haired
man eagerly. “Just jumpy. I wouldn’t worry
about it, if I was you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeh? You’re right—<i>you</i> wouldn’t worry!
That takes brains! Get out, both of you, scram!”</p>

<p>He reached for the drawer in his cabin desk and
both men tried to get out the small door abreast.
The result was ludicrous in the extreme and Hegarty
relieved himself by a thoroughly good laugh!</p>

<p>Convinced because he had no real grounds for
suspicion of the two boys in the trim white yacht,
he forgot about the incident and did not refer to
it again though he was to regret that result some
time later!</p>

<p>“Is there any sight of the <i>Canton</i> yet?” he asked
the man on lookout in the bridge enclosure of the
big craft as he went out of his cabin and up the
steps.</p>

<p>The man shook his head negatively.</p>

<p>“Well, keep your eyes peeled. He’s due any
hour now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“You bet. Say, we’ll have some navy here fer
the big raid, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“We’ll need it! Nevada will be expecting us
and we gotta be prepared!”</p>

<p>The boys kept down in the cabin the rest of the
day until evening when still another yacht came
in, this also painted the same shiny black. It
anchored close to the first two, an extremely able-looking
“commuter” type cabin cruiser bearing
the name <i>Canton</i> on her name boards. The sun
was setting by the time supper was over and the
boys watched an outboard-motored tender going
to the town dock, roaring along.</p>

<p>“Town is the place for us, to-night, John!”
Stan said.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to Porpoise Island to-night?”</p>

<p>“No-sirree! Hegarty is likely going ashore
with his lieutenants and we’ve got work to do.
Get your portable fingerprint outfit and lens
ready, and let’s go!”</p>

<p>“Bows and arrows, Skipper?”</p>

<p>“Not this time. We want to appear innocent
and we don’t want bows between our legs if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
have to skip up an alley or two. How’s for some
soda, John?”</p>

<p>John grinned knowingly and they were shortly
headed for shore. Quietly, they pulled in, keeping
in the darkness, away from the side of the
wharf at which they could see the dim, shiny outlines
of the tender from the <i>Sea Hawk</i>. They
pulled the skiff ashore at the land end of the pier
and strolled up to the dock.</p>

<p>A peek round the edge of the piling on the
wharf on the other side showed a man sitting in the
tender there, waiting.</p>

<p>“No chance to get aboard her yet, John,” Stan
said, “so let’s head for the restaurant.”</p>

<p>They entered the restaurant by a side door, unobserved,
and were able to slip into their seats
quietly. Hegarty had his back to them and none
of the men really were faced their way, so the
boys hoped to escape suspicion. It was a ticklish
moment! They ordered coffee and rolls with
bacon, in spite of Stan’s reference to soda.</p>

<p>Hegarty and his men seemed nervous but carefree.
They kept hard eyes on the door to the
street but cracked jokes with apparent ease and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
talked in low tones between times while they
sipped beer.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re the boys as bought the beer bottle,
aren’t you?” queried the proprietor as he came
with the order.</p>

<p>Gulping hard in spite of himself, Stan
“shushed” him away as soon as possible. None
of the men at the other table appeared to have
heard the remark for they were all engrossed in
examining a photograph which Hegarty was now
passing around to the men.</p>

<p>“That the bird?” queried one.</p>

<p>“Yeh! Take a good look at him. I had plenty
trouble digging that up. But I found a way!”</p>

<p>“So he’s a Fed, eh? Say, I always wanted to
get a good look at one of those guys!”</p>

<p>“You’ll get a chance to make a sieve of him
when we get to Porpoise Island, boys,” said Hegarty.
“And I figures we’ll go over there Wednesday
night ’stead of Thursday!”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a surprise, eh, Hegarty?”</p>

<p>“It’s gotta be or we’ll have the whole F. B. I. in
on us!” said the head gangster, chuckling.</p>

<p>And Stanley Sandborn held his breath for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
had not only heard distinctly all that was said, so
acute was his hearing made by the mention of
“Feds,” but he had a good look at the photograph
one of the men was handing back to Hegarty! It
was a good clear photograph of Gallagher!</p>

The G-Men Close In</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">STANLEY SANDBORN realized that
there was little time to lose. Hegarty’s
plans had been changed, and the identity of Mr.
Sandborn was no longer a secret! Hegarty was
evidently not intending to drop out of the picture
with a G-man in it. He had too big stakes in the
game, was gambling for too much power, to let
even the fear of “Federal heat” deter him from
his course. Without a doubt his chief aim was to
capture the lavish stores of wealth he believed
Nevada to possess. If things worked out right
then, he would also have control of the syndicate
which the ex-cowboy had built up. If a Fed was
killed in the squabble it was just too bad for the
Fed!</p>

<p>The sandy-haired youth arose, winked at John,
paid their bill, and they left by the same side
door through which they had entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Out in the street, away from the restaurant he
acted even more quickly, racing for the nearest
store. It was a magazine and novelty place, and
what he wanted was visible through the window—a
phone booth! Into this he went as casually as
possible while John made a purchase or two to
keep the proprietor busy.</p>

<p>When Stan came out of that booth he was grinning
a little. They went outside.</p>

<p>“O.k.?” queried John.</p>

<p>“I got Main Haven’s G-man on the phone and
he’s letting the big Chief know. That’ll help keep
Dad safer unless Nevada gets wise to his real
identity! We’ve got less time and just as much
work to do now. It’s Porpoise Island for us to-night,
after all!”</p>

<p>“We’re as good as there!” John commented
eagerly.</p>

<p>“But I’ve a chore to do first, John. Skip to
our boat and wait for me!”</p>

<p>“Oars out?”</p>

<p>“You bet, I may come on a run!”</p>

<p>He was gone a few minutes after John got into
their rowboat, and he did come back running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“I got it!” he cried triumphantly as he jumped
in and helped shove off.</p>

<p>Mystified, John rowed away.</p>

<p>“Got what, Skipper? Not a hundred dollar
bank note, I trust!”</p>

<p>“No, but something that will help stick those
babies behind the bars when exhibited in court!”
observed Stan gleefully.</p>

<p>He would say no more, and John rowed swiftly
to the <i>Staghound</i>.</p>

<p>“Get the sails up, Mate,” ordered the G-man’s
son as he hurried below. “We’ve got to get into
motion!”</p>

<p>They were off Zenith Light and laying a compass
course for Porpoise Island when Stan took
the wheel and told John to go below, if he liked,
and see what they had to add to their evidence.
The lanky youth did so, and whistled. It was a
rubber handle neatly removed by a jackknife, slit
from the motor of the <i>Sea Hawk’s</i> tender, and on
it silver powder had been scattered lightly by the
joyful Stanley to bring out several very fine
fingerprints.</p>

<p>“How many men left their prints, I wonder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Stan?” asked John, returning to the cockpit and
closing the cabin slide to hide the extra light.</p>

<p>Stan rejoined, “Looks like three to me. We’ll
know who did it later when Dad gets a chance
to have the F. B. I. look them up in the fingerprint
files!”</p>

<p>Back at the boat wharf a group of men argued
over the discovery that the handle to the tender’s
motor was no longer rubber covered!</p>

<p>“Where were you while it happened?” Hegarty
demanded of an abashed thin chap who had been
left at the tender.</p>

<p>“Just went in town on an errand, boss, and
come right back!” he confessed.</p>

<p>“Well, whoever did that must have had a good
reason and——”</p>

<p>One of the men in business suits with Hegarty
gave a low curse of anger.</p>

<p>“Fingerprints is what they wanted whoever
done it!” he said aloud.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Hegarty. “And I bet it was
them kids! Come on; what are we waiting for.
Let’s get going after them!”</p>

<p>But the boys had been gone some time now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
and the racing rowboat, overloaded and hard to
manage, circled the harbor without any luck while
the valuable minutes passed. Then Hegarty was
put aboard the <i>Sea Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>“Get under way, boss?” asked a sailor at the
controls on the bridge.</p>

<p>“No!” snapped Hegarty, and he went below
to his cabin where he was shortly closeted with his
lieutenants.</p>

<p>“Why not chase the kids further, Hegarty?”
asked one.</p>

<p>“What’s the use? You can’t expect to find a
small sloop in the bay on a night like this, or any
night for that matter! We’ll find ’em to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Who handled the motor grip, boss?”</p>

<p>Hegarty winced.</p>

<p>“You and me and him all gripped it in succession
as we steadied ourselves to step to the wharf!”
he groaned.</p>

<p>On the waters of the bay the sloop forged ahead
for the Island at her fastest gait, and soon was
cruising in the darkness along the north shore,
hunting for a certain new cove into which to slip.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
She was running in at slackened speed under the
starlight when something fast and dark hummed
in behind her! It was a speedboat coming at
moderate velocity, and both boys were startled.</p>

<p>“The bows, John!” yelled Stan, and the Mate
went below, returning at once with their weapons.</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s Dago and the mob?” John
asked, putting an arrow to the string. “Indigo
nanny goats, what breaks we get!”</p>

<p>Stan had no chance to reply, for a searchlight
was flung for an instant full upon the boat, then
as quickly shut off. In another split second,
blinded as he was by the flare of light, John would
have let fly with an arrow anyhow, but a voice
commanding, yet friendly, came distinctly to the
boys.</p>

<p>“This is the law, boys! Heave to, while we
come aboard!”</p>

<p>“What law?” demanded Stan doubtfully,
trembling a little in spite of his courage.</p>

<p>“Men of the F. B. I., boys! John sent us!” came
the answer.</p>

<p>Tingling with excitement, the boys hove to and
the boat drew down upon them and swung alongside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
It was clear, for the starlight reflected from
its surface, that the boat was not one of the familiar
gray speedboats. The men stepped easily
aboard the sloop, and one remained with the
motorboat while she drifted away at the end of a
line.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and anchor when you are ready,
boys,” said the leader, speaking quietly.</p>

<p>The anchor was dropped overboard and the
sails were smartly lowered. Then the boys led
the men below, the leader, clean-shaven, smart
appearing, with clear blue eyes and a firm mouth,
the others, three in number, being all ordinary-appearing
young men, yet each looking quite
capable of taking care of himself in an argument.
They seated themselves in the now crowded cabin
upon bunks and the table, and got down to the
point of the visit.</p>

<p>“John got us at once, after you phoned, Sandborn,”
said the leader. “I’m the agent in charge
of this district—Holmes is the name—and these
are my men.”</p>

<p>“Dad works under you part of the time, doesn’t
he?” queried Stan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“That’s right. This time he’s on his own
by order of the big Chief. We’re here to snap
up these gangster rats when their big battle
starts.”</p>

<p>“IT’S starting Wednesday night instead of
Thursday!” Stan said, excitedly.</p>

<p>“So John informs us, Sandborn,” Holmes said.
“Now, we just found you by accident. We’d
been planning to drop in along here later but
made it to-night due to the emergency, and you
chose the same cove!”</p>

<p>“Want us to get out?”</p>

<p>“No. You stay right here. We’ll shove off
towards dawn and hide further down, to the west.
What were your plans in anchoring here?”</p>

<p>Stanley explained that they were intending to
go ashore, hiding the tender, find out what they
could in the darkness, and, at daybreak, take pictures
from cover and try for fingerprints.</p>

<p>“The idea is fine, boys, so go ahead. We’ll be
round here till dawn; that is, the man on watch
will be. The rest of us are going to do some
sleuthing on our own to-night! If anything happens,
remember to head for this cove! By the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
way, you heard about the boner Dago pulled the
other night, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No; what was it?” Stan asked, mystified.</p>

<p>“He and some other men were out apparently
hunting for some one in one of the gray boats and
they overtook and boarded a New York yacht off
Porpoise Island! The owner thought them modern
pirates and blasted away with an automatic!”</p>

<p>Laughter rang in the cabin as the other men
joined in with Holmes’ amused roar.</p>

<p>“He was luckily a bum shot and hurt no one,
but Dago pushed off in a big hurry, leaving a
gun behind on the yacht’s deck! The thing got
in the papers of course, though the yacht owner
naturally didn’t realize who had boarded him, and
I got to him and to the police and got possession of
the gun, upon which I found some very excellent
imprints of the honorable Mr. Dago’s fingers!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the police search for the gray boat?”</p>

<p>“Sure; but you know how Black Cove is, hidden
away! They either forgot it or passed it up as a
hiding place somehow, for they did not sight any
suspicious boats! I guess that police boat crew is
still wondering where the ‘pirates’ came from!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>After some more conversation the boys went
ashore in their little tender which they had carried
on the port side of the deck, upside down, during
the run from Zenith, and carried it up the beach
and into some bushes to hide it before hunting for
a trail inland. Soon they were moving along a
trail, bows and arrows in hand, flashlights in
pockets, and fingerprint outfits and the spare
camera along, too. Thus laden, they got over the
Island under the starlit sky and were soon close
to the cove.</p>

<p>Moving cautiously and slowly, they came along
the path upon which their adventures had begun,
and down through bushes to the shore. There
they had a grand stand seat from which to study
the activity on the scow. The scow was anchored
in its regular spot for night work, and lights glimmered
and men moved about!</p>

<p>They stayed there for some time consumed by
unsatisfied curiosity.</p>

<p>From that spot, unchallenged, they passed
through a maze of paths to the south ridge back
of the cabin and were going along in the dark,
when Stan grasped John by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“A tunnel, for sure, John!” he said.</p>

<p>It was indeed a half concealed entrance to a
tunnel, and the two boys stood before it, nervous
and eager.</p>

<p>“Shall we go in?” John asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” said a voice from the darkness,
close by. “But I’m going with you!”</p>

<p>It was Holmes, who now stepped from the
bushes.</p>

<p>“Where you been all this time, Mr. Holmes?”
asked Stan, puzzled at the coincidence of that
meeting.</p>

<p>Holmes chuckled.</p>

<p>“I’ve been following you, and I’ll admit you
are cagy sleuths. I nearly lost you a dozen times.
Hold it—here comes the enemy!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XV</small><br>

The Boys Become Prisoners</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE hoarse voice of Dago was rather near
on the path as the G-man and the two boys
ducked into the tunnel and groped hurriedly
along, seeking for a hiding place off the main
tunnel. They had gone but a short distance when
they heard Dago and his men coming down behind
them, and backward glimpses showed the lights
of flashlights! The tunnel seemed endless, and
was quite straight! The boys and their protector
began to run, softly, but swiftly! Would they
never find a side aisle?</p>

<p>Then Stanley grabbed John and ducked to the
right into a dark side tunnel, and Holmes followed
at once. There the three crouched, wondering
what was to happen next!</p>

<p>Dago came along talking with Butch, and
passed the end of the tunnel. As he did so he was
heard to say,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“How you gonna prove it, Wan Ho? You
have to-a have proof. Cowboy ain’t-a going to
just take-a da hunch!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I’m going to prove it to
Cowboy, Dago, but I’ll try to get something
definite,” said Wan Ho Din as they moved off.
“For all we know this Gallagher is a G-man!”</p>

<p>As the darkness became intense again in the
main tunnel, the boys and their friend came out
of the side aisle and pushed on, following Dago.
But progress was slow in the blackness, and
Holmes began flashing his light on and off at intervals.
By this means they shortly found a side aisle
wider than the others and so went on into a fair
sized room in which great stacks of supplies were
piled up. One pile was a group of small, but
strong looking, cases upon whose exteriors were
stamped the name of a famous brand of liquor.
The cases showed all the signs of having been
submerged in sea water a long time, for they
were wet looking and mildewed and spotted with
barnacles and bits of algae.</p>

<p>“There’s part of the cargo the unknown yacht
holds, boys,” Holmes said. “You keep watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
while I try to get a peek into one of the cases! I’m
willing to bet it doesn’t contain liquor!”</p>

<p>But he had no chance to solve the mystery of
the cases, for, even as he began to search for a
way to break into one, lights and footfalls interrupted.
The trio ducked behind and among some
barrels and waited a while; then they came out of
their hiding places.</p>

<p>“We better get back to the surface, boys,” said
Holmes. “I’ve a hunch we’ll be trapped before
long if we don’t! And, once we are captured—the
jig is up!”</p>

<p>Knowing that he was right, the boys consented
to go back by the tunnel to the entrance. This
they now did, at a better pace than on the inbound
trip, for the way was somewhat more familiar
now. They emerged cautiously into the night
and it seemed quite light compared to the blackness
of that underground passage. The stars
twinkled overhead, and it was hard to believe that,
beneath those high-riding points of light, men on
this earth were scheming to destroy the traditions
of a people, their law and order, for money, power,
and a dictatorship!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“I’m going to see how my men are making out,
boys. Keep out of any tunnels from now on,
to-night, at least, and don’t get picked up by
Nevada’s men, whatever you do.”</p>

<p>As he went off silently into the night, the boys
retired also, to the safety of some thick bushes and
a grove of low trees, where they talked in low
voices.</p>

<p>“Looks as if Wan Ho Din and Dago suspect
Dad’s real identity,” commented Stan. “And
between Hegarty knowing for sure who Gallagher
is, and the others suspecting him, it looks
to me as though things may happen quicker than
we reckon!”</p>

<p>The two boys now went round, with great care,
to their old spot at the cove’s edge where, from
under the overhanging branches of trees, they
could watch the nightly salvage job again. And
while they took turns with the binoculars while the
men on the scow worked, Gallagher and Mr.
Nevens were smoking in the latter’s office, discussing
the best way to line up the bakeries into the
syndicate’s organization. They were thus engaged
when Wan Ho Din and Dago dropped in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“Did you check the ammunition, boys?” asked
Cowboy, looking up from his desk.</p>

<p>“Yeh, we got-a plenty lead for the typewriters,
Boss!” Dago informed him.</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“You bet! Say, you don’t s’pose this Hegarty
guy might try to-a spring-a the surprise——?”</p>

<p>Cowboy regarded Dago with a grin.</p>

<p>“Getting nervous, Dago?”</p>

<p>Dago scowled.</p>

<p>“Me? Naw!”</p>

<p>Cowboy reached for another black cigar, lit it
leisurely, puffed once or twice, and then leaned
back in his chair, shifting his feet to the desk top.</p>

<p>“Hegarty may try anything,” said he, quietly,
“so just be on the lookout. You better post plenty
of guards, Dago. Wan, you stay here and take
some notes. Gallagher and I gotta ring the
bakeries in on our service!”</p>

<p>Dago took Butch along to make the rounds of
the Island, and they placed men at strategic points
so that anyone attempting to surprise them from
the sea would receive a warm and metallic reception!
They thought themselves pretty smart in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
their plans, but two boys and a number of ordinary-appearing
young men hovered in the darkness
close by, gathering all information that could be
figured out from the low toned conversation of
Dago and the men.</p>

<p>Towards morning Stanley and John took cover
in a grove of trees and lay down to sleep; that is, to
take turns sleeping, for the other in each case must
keep alert for searchers! Nothing happened to
disturb their snatches of slumber that night, and
at dawn they were stretching weary limbs. John
had produced doughnuts, which they ate with
satisfaction, and they quenched their thirst at a
half concealed spring some distance from the
cabin.</p>

<p>Their problem was now to get photographs
worthy of submission as court evidence, and they
had to get those pictures without being seen! It
was no easy task, and was further complicated by
a desire to pick up fingerprints, too.</p>

<p>But the two boy detectives were not to be
stumped by the appearance of a hard task, and
they set to work at once. They closed in on the
cabin by following the paths, crouched low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>It took a great deal of time that Tuesday morning
to work up to the cabin, for every now and
then they had to duck from sight and hug cover
while Dago, Wan Ho Din, or others traveled the
paths on errands of preparation for the expected
raid from the <i>Sea Hawk</i>. Stan was anxious to
see Mr. Sandborn and warn him of the latest
dangers, but he saw not a glimpse of the G-man.
They worked close enough to the cabin to get two
excellent shots and then got up to the aquarium
for more snaps. It was in the midst of this operation
that they were discovered!</p>

<p>Stan was putting a new film in his camera, when
he looked up from his place of concealment to
stare right into the swarthy face of none other
than Dago!</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Dago. “You boys pickin’
the blueberries, eh?”</p>

<p>John was right behind Stan, bow in hand, but
there was no time to set an arrow in the notch, and
besides, the extremely thick nature of the shrubbery
behind them barred either a fight or a retreat
and escape!</p>

<p>“Hello, Dago!” said Stan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>For answer Dago reached through the leaves
and grabbed Stan securely by the nape of the
neck, dragged him into the open, and shook him.
As he performed that pleasurable feat, he grinned
while Wan Ho Din nabbed John the same way,
and the two boys were shortly headed for the
cabin, prisoners!</p>

<p>Stan and John both realized that to twist free
of those strong hands and run would invite a
speedy death from bullets or result in a prompt
recapture anyhow by other members of Nevada’s
gang scattered all about round the cove. It was
better, for the moment, to go peacefully. But it
made the hearts and hopes of the boys drop.</p>

<p>They were hustled into the cabin and up to
Nevada’s den. Roughly, Dago and Wan shoved
them into the room. Cowboy Nevada bit so hard
on his cigar as the door opened and in came the
captors and captives, that he bit the end right off
that cigar!</p>

<p>“Well look who drops in on us, Gallagher!”
said Nevada. “The two kids I been wanting so
long!”</p>

<p>Fighting to hide the conflicting emotions almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
overpowering him at sight of his fine Dad
sitting there in that dangerous atmosphere of
crime, Stanley tried hard to avoid the G-man’s
eyes. John got red and swallowed very hard.
Gallagher grinned with amusement.</p>

<p>“So these is the kids what helped get Hogan?”
he asked Nevada, softly.</p>

<p>“Yeh, imagine that!” said Cowboy dryly.</p>

<p>“Kin I take-a them out and-a drown ’em,
Boss?” begged Dago.</p>

<p>“Dago,” said Cowboy, surprised. “I can
hardly believe my ears!—Nor my eyes!”</p>

<p>Dago shifted uneasily on his feet, embarrassed.
Hadn’t the boss expressed a wish to see the kids
wiped out many a time in the last week? And
now he, Dago, proposed getting rid of them
pronto, the Boss was “Surprised!”</p>

<p>“Whatcha mean, boss?” demanded Dago.</p>

<p>Cowboy grinned.</p>

<p>“Dago,” said he, “knowing you as I do, I am
astonished that you hadn’t tried drowning them
already!”</p>

<p>“Swell, thanks!” cried Dago, starting for the
door with a boy held by each of his red paws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Thanks——”</p>

<p>“Drop them!” came Nevada’s rasping order.</p>

<p>“But you said, boss——”</p>

<p>“Drop them, I said. Gallagher here is gonna
do the drowning or whatever he wants to use
rubbin’ them out!”</p>

<p>He pulled out another black cigar and, lighting
it, said, curtly, “Scram, Dago!”</p>

<p>Dago did!</p>

The Fight Begins</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT Zenith Point Hegarty, starting Tuesday
morning, had paced the deck all day, stopping
hardly for meals, cursing fluently at the
slightest interruption of his thoughts, and finally
retiring to his cabin in the late afternoon to which
he shortly summoned his lieutenants.</p>

<p>They were a cold and hard-appearing group of
men quite in contrast to the emotional Hegarty
who now laid before them a proposition.</p>

<p>“You, Marzonij,” said he to the smallest of the
men.</p>

<p>“Yeh, Boss?” the fellow replied, expectantly.</p>

<p>Thin, pale-faced, he did not look as one would
expect him to look, for Marzonij was Hegarty’s
best gunman, a merciless killer when doped with
a certain drug to which he was addicted. But, because
he was small, he could slip up alleys faster in
the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“How’s your rod, Marzonij?” asked Hegarty
as evenly as he could.</p>

<p>“O.k., Boss. My finger’s itchin’ fer the trigger!”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the lay-out, Marzonij,” said
Hegarty, talking fast but distinctly now as if he
had thought the whole thing out. “We know
this Gallagher is a Fed. If Cowboy knew it, he’d
bump him off, and it just might be a help to us.
Not only would we be clear of a bit of typewriting
by that guy who is a perfect shot, but the blame
for the killing could be laid to Cowboy!”</p>

<p>“How you want me to do it, Boss?”</p>

<p>“Well, the boys at the island expect us Thursday
at midnight, don’t they?”</p>

<p>Several men nodded, curtly.</p>

<p>“We been planning to make it Wednesday
and surprise them. Well, we’re going to do it
<i>to-night</i> instead!”</p>

<p>A chorus of approval greeted this piece of news.</p>

<p>“And more than that: Marzonij is going to go
to the island now, make a deal to sign up with
Cowboy, if he can, and tip Cowboy off to Gallagher’s
real name and job! Marzonij is going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
be on the spot when we get there and maybe—”
he paused for effect, “Maybe——”</p>

<p>“—Maybe I’ll get a shot at Cowboy, eh?”
queried Marzonij eagerly.</p>

<p>Hegarty grinned.</p>

<p>“Marzonij,” said he, “you should oughta go to
the head of the class!”</p>

<p>The little man was shortly headed for Porpoise
Island, guiding a varnished tender while a powerful
outboard motor roared as he crossed the bay.
He patted the area under his left armpit reassuringly
now and then grinned. He was not only
heading for a job he would enjoy, but he’d soon
be assistant to Hegarty as head of Cowboy’s swell
syndicate.</p>

<p>He circled the sea side of Porpoise Island, located
the cove and went in fast, roaring up to the
landing-stage as if some one were apt to appear in
pursuit at any moment.</p>

<p>“Where’s Nevada?” he demanded as one of Mr.
Nevens’ henchmen came forward on the wharf to
investigate.</p>

<p>“In conference, fellow!” said the mobster testily.
“What-a you want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“I gotta see him right off. I got news!”</p>

<p>“Wait here and I’ll see if he’ll talk to ya!” the
man said.</p>

<p>As he turned to go, he met Dago who had just
come from the cabin. Dago frowned as he surveyed
Marzonij.</p>

<p>“<i>I’ll</i> see Cowboy for you,” Dago said. “I’ll be
back soon.”</p>

<p>“But what the devil would Marzonij want to
tell me?” Cowboy said aloud. “Well, show him
up. And you, Gallagher, keep the guy covered.
This may be a trap!”</p>

<p>Marzonij came in with Dago and confronted
the man he hoped soon to kill.</p>

<p>“How-ya, Cowboy?” said he by way of greeting.</p>

<p>“Nice day,” Cowboy said, crisply.</p>

<p>“I got news fer you, Cowboy, private news.”</p>

<p>“You kin talk in front of Gallagher.”</p>

<p>Marzonij frowned.</p>

<p>“This news has gotta be said <i>alone</i>.”</p>

<p>“Not till you’re frisked, first, Marzonij,” said
Cowboy, quietly.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, frisk me, but all I’m carrying is my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
regular cannon. No trick rods or nothing.
Nevada, I’m hoping to sign on with you!”</p>

<p>Cowboy Nevada lit himself a black cigar and
motioned Dago to frisk the informer. Dago produced
the automatic from the armpit holster,
nothing else. Cowboy nodded to Gallagher and
the G-man got up and went out with Dago and
Wan Ho Din.</p>

<p>Back in the room Cowboy said curtly, “Get
talking!”</p>

<p>Marzonij did, saying in brief, that he and
Hegarty had had a falling out and besides he,
Marzonij, figgered Cowboy was likely to win the
coming scrap.</p>

<p>“To show you I’m all right,” Marzonij said,
“let me tell ya that the raid is coming Wednesday
night, to-morrow night, instead of Thursday!”</p>

<p>Cowboy puffed on his cigar quietly.</p>

<p>“I guessed as much anyhow.”</p>

<p>“And another thing, Hegarty found out the
dope on this Gallagher guy and I swiped something
to show you!”</p>

<p>He produced a photograph from his inside
pocket and handed it to Cowboy. He also produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
a newspaper clipping and showed it to
the crime head. The clipping was headed by a
photo just like the original print.</p>

<p>“<span class="allsmcap">SANDBORN LANDS GOVERNMENT JOB!</span>”</p>

<p>The clipping, clipped from an old newspaper,
explained that Mr. Sandborn had been successful
in going to work for the government in one of the
law-enforcement agencies. It did not give details
(for it had so happened that Mr. Sandborn had
kept the details very secret) but it gave his home
address.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get this?” demanded Cowboy,
staring hard.</p>

<p>“Well, Hegarty, as ya know, has a keen memory
fer faces, and he had a hunch, after he met
Gallagher that he’d seen tha face somewhere’s
before so he goes to work and has a bunch of us
hunting through the local papers fer a picture of
Gallagher, ’cause Hegarty has the hunch the
guy’s a local man! And, after a lotta looking he
finds this clipping in the old file of the newspaper
and being as the guy’s address and that of the kids
what helped get Hogan is alike we figures we kin
get a clear picture at the guy’s home. So we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
breaks in quiet one night and gets us a picture
from the guy’s private den and this is it! Hegarty
remembers reading the clipping in the paper
some time back and he says, ‘This Gallagher
guy is a G-man by the name o’ Sandborn!
That’s the only answer to him working for
Cowboy!’”</p>

<p>Cowboy Nevada’s cigar had gone out as he
listened and he discarded it while he stared into
space.</p>

<p>“Gallagher’s a G-man!” he muttered. “Yeh,
that’s right! That would explain everything!
No wonder the guy’s such a crack shot with a
tommy-gun!”</p>

<p>Suddenly Cowboy Nevada felt chilly though
the room was quite warm. Cold chills ran down
his back! Why, he’d <i>explained</i> everything to
Gallagher! <i>Told</i> him everything! <i>Showed</i> him
everything! <i>And the guy was a G-man!</i> Cowboy
began to sweat a little till his palms were moist!
He hadn’t figured on tackling the F. B. I. yet
awhile! He had wanted time to take over the
control of politics first, then he’d have found a
way to break up that band of law-men! Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
he’d have to battle the F. B. I. and Hegarty, too!
Cowboy turned savagely on Marzonij.</p>

<p>“Listen, you rat!” said he, “you get back to
Hegarty and stay there! I been pretty good on
hunches all my life. I had a hunch Gallagher was
o.k. Well, I got stung! I can’t trust my hunches
anymore! How do I know you ain’t aiming to
bump me off for Hegarty, you little——!”</p>

<p>Cowboy Nevada paused for breath.</p>

<p>“Scram, Marzonij,” said he, “before I lose me
code of ethics and rub you out! Get going and
keep going!”</p>

<p>He crumpled the clipping and the photograph
and stuck them into his desk-drawer, and Marzonij
left, unarmed.</p>

<p>“Take Marzonij to his boat!” said Cowboy to
Wan Ho Din, “and see that he gets outa Black
Cove and stays out!”</p>

<p>After that he sent Gallagher on an errand to
one of the supply rooms while he closeted himself
with Dago.</p>

<p>“Dago,” said he, “I ain’t too sure of Gallagher!”</p>

<p>Dago brightened perceptibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“I ain’t never been, boss. I gotta sneakin’
notion that Gallagher ain’t what he says he is.
I gotta idea he-a——”</p>

<p>“Well——?”</p>

<p>“He might even be a Fed, Boss!” said Dago,
taking a deep breath as if he expected Cowboy
to shoot him on the spot for that idea.</p>

<p>Amazement overran Dago’s face as Cowboy
grinned.</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i>—Dago!”</p>

<p>Dago ran a thick forefinger slowly round his
neckband while perspiration stood out in big
beads on his red forehead! Slowly and deliberately
he swallowed.</p>

<p>“Yer kiddin’, Boss!”</p>

<p>“This ain’t no time fer kiddin’, Dago! We
gotta get rid of the kids and Sandborn.”</p>

<p>“‘Sandborn?’” Dago asked slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>“Yeh, you see, the yellow-haired kid is really—a
G-man’s son!”</p>

<p>“No wonder the kid helped get Hogan!” said
Dago. “With his old man a dick!”</p>

<p>Cowboy put his feet down on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“We got work to do, Dago. First we gotta get
rid of our guests, then we gotta get ready for
Hegarty. He’s due Wednesday night ’stead of
Thursday!”</p>

<p>A loud rumbling sound penetrated the cabin,
followed by several staccato sounds. Dago regarded
Cowboy with thoughtful and worried
gaze.</p>

<p>“Due Wednesday, Boss?”</p>

<p>Cowboy grabbed his six-shooters from their
holsters and started for the door as the cabin reverberated
with gunfire!</p>

<p>“They’re here <i>now</i>, Dago!” he yelled. “Come
on!”</p>

G-Men to the Attack</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the interview in Mr. Nevens’ den at
which their fate had been sealed so far as
Nevada was concerned, the two boys were hustled
to the waiting room in which Stanley had been
confined not so long ago. It was Gallagher who
took them there and strange thoughts were running
through his mind as he firmly held the two
lads. He was pondering the irony of a fate that
demands that a man be ordained the executioner
of his own boy. And he was solemnly assuring
himself that before that deed was to be done he
would wipe out Nevada, Dago, and the entire
rotten gang if he had to do it one by one and on
his own authority!</p>

<p>Stanley walked bravely along, confident that
his resourceful father would prevent harm from
striking him. John Tallman, too, felt better even
though Cowboy wanted their lives, for he was sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
that Mr. Sandborn would find some way to save
them. Indeed, both boys were less concerned with
their own physical safety than they were with how
this case would turn out. The future looked
pretty dark at that moment!</p>

<p>Once in the small waiting room, which was now
fitted with stacks of ammunition and several
machine guns, showing the provision Cowboy
Nevada was making for the expected attack by
Hegarty, Mr. Sandborn whispered encouragement
to the boys.</p>

<p>“We’ll lick this whole rotten crime syndicate,
boys,” said he. “Don’t worry. You keep your
chins up and you’ll be o.k. I’ll stall till dark for
time and at dark I’ll arrange to take you boys out
with Butch in one of the speedboats as if to drown
you. I haven’t figured out the rest yet but I’ve a
hunch Butch is going to end up at Main Haven,
our prisoner, and that the F. B. I. will have this
situation well under control shortly afterwards!”</p>

<p>“What about the plans of the Chief to nab
Hegarty and Cowboy both the night of the attack,
Dad? That’s to-morrow, you know!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Part of the success of the F. B. I. is due to its
ability to meet a situation as it arises. The boys
are ready to close in any time I tip them off!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn then gave a cue for silence as
Butch was heard coming down the tunnel to relieve
Gallagher.</p>

<p>“Take care of these kids, Butch,” Gallagher
said; “and watch out fer them. They’re pretty
tough kids!”</p>

<p>“I’m scairt to death already, Gallagher!”
roared Butch. “Dago’s the man for this job.
Why he’d be sick at the thought of it. When he
has nightmares it’s on account o’ dreamin’ of these
kids here!”</p>

<p>Alone with the boys Butch ordered them to sit
on a bench along the opposite wall while he regaled
himself with cigarettes and the only easy
chair in the underground room. Bluff, sloppy,
big-mouthed, Butch would hardly have been recognized
as the mean and wanton killer that he
really was. His carefree attitude was really a
mask to hide the fact that he was a haunted man,
expecting any time the bullets that would put a
period to his underworld existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“So you’re the kids as scare Dago!” he muttered,
grinning. “Where’s yer bows and arrows?”</p>

<p>That was just what Stanley and John were
wondering. Probably back in the bushes from
which the boys had been yanked awhile ago! If
only they had those bows and arrows now and a
second of time to draw back on the bow strings!
Escape they knew they must for, although they
felt sure Mr. Sandborn would be able to prevent
them from getting hurt, yet they knew that that
might also prevent the working out of the F. B. I.’s
plans to get both Hegarty and Nevada! They
could not sit idly back because they seemed checkmated,
and just wait for some one to come along
and free them!</p>

<p>“I guess our bows are gone for good,” said
Stanley to Butch. “And things don’t look so good
for us, either!”</p>

<p>Butch continued to grin.</p>

<p>“Dyin’ ain’t any fun, eh?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Nevens wouldn’t really hurt us, would
he, Butch?” asked Stanley innocently.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Butch. “He don’t like to kill kids,
not with guns. He’s partial ta fryin’ them in oil!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>This outburst of humor called for a big laugh;
so Butch enjoyed his own joke to its fullest.</p>

<p>“Well, blow me down!” observed John. “And
cook me for a sweet potato! By all the chinks in
far Hong Kong! ‘Sweep the floor, oh, Sally dear,
for father’s comin’ home!’”</p>

<p>He would have gone on in that characteristic
manner, half singing, half talking, but Stan
stopped him, amused at John’s excited remarks,
in spite of the tense situation.</p>

<p>“You don’t think up them sayings all yourself?”
queried Butch. “Now, <i>do</i> you?”</p>

<p>“Serve the coffee piping hot and sally down the
forepeak, Tim!” began John again, in deep disgust
while he glared at Butch with eyes that spoke
volumes.</p>

<p>“How does that go?” Butch asked. “Say, say
that again, kid, that was a good one!”</p>

<p>But John had lapsed into a forlorn silence
which was broken now and then by a slight muttering.
Stan leaned back, trying to think of a
way out of their predicament and Butch, after
staring at John as if he were something on exhibition
in a zoo, began to nod and blink sleepily. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
yawned and gaped profusely, slid down further
in his chair, and half-closed his eyes. Dago might
be frightened by two kids, but Butch had no misgivings!
Unfortunate Butch——!</p>

<p>After Marzonij had left the harbor at Zenith,
Hegarty waited impatiently for sunset before
ordering the anchors up. He knew that it would
have taken an hour or so for his henchman to contact
Nevada and he did not want to get to Porpoise
himself till nearly dark. As a matter of
fact, it was nearly dark before the <i>Sea Hawk</i>
moved in towards Black Cove.</p>

<p>And by that time the entire situation on the island
had changed. Marzonij had contacted Cowboy,
informed on Mr. Sandborn, it being dusk
then, and had climbed into his boat to leave the
cove, while Wan Ho Din looked on, when some
one up on the west ridge began firing with a
tommy-gun! Thinking the shots were intended
for himself, Marzonij lost no time in getting
under way and roaring through the channel into
the semi-darkness outside.</p>

<p>But what had really happened was that some
one in a machine gun nest on the ridge had spotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
one of Hegarty’s men from the <i>Malcon</i>. The
swift <i>Malcon</i> had anchored in the cove on the west
end of the island, where the <i>Staghound</i> had
moored before, and had sent men ashore as the
land move of the Hegarty attack. These men had
received orders to locate the gun nests but not
to be seen; but one of them had made a mistake——!</p>

<p>Creeping through the underbrush towards the
spot where they had been forced to abandon their
weapons, the G-man’s son and John Tallman lay
frozen as they listened to the rat-tat-tat of
machine gun fire.</p>

<p>“Braid my dog’s great whiskers!” whispered
John, “the fight’s on!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to find our bows, John. Sooner or
later in this scrap we’re going to need them! It’ll
soon be too dark to find them!”</p>

<p>They moved on, hoping they were not moving
into any zone of fire!</p>

<p>“I have to laugh every time I think of Butch’s
face when he opened his eyes!” chuckled Stan.
“He sure was a surprised man!”</p>

<p>“You’d be, too,” said John, “if you’d gone to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
sleep with a couple of kid prisoners and then woke
up to find yourself bound and gagged! We had
to work fast, though, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Stan nodded.</p>

<p>They had indeed worked fast when Stan gave
the signal as Butch slept late that afternoon, tying
his arms swiftly with rope and gagging him
with a knotted handkerchief. Butch’s circulation
might be sluggish in the wrists for a while, so
tight were the cords, but at least he wouldn’t be
getting free of his bonds!</p>

<p>“Whoops!” came Stan’s joyous half-yell.
“Here’s my bow and yours! And our arrows!”</p>

<p>They recovered their weapons, drew deeper into
the shrubbery and considered their next move. By
now the air was tingling with gunfire and the
shouts of men.</p>

<p>“Apparently so far Hegarty’s men are attacking
from the west end of the island, John,” Stan
said; “but it’s pretty certain he’ll get his boats
into the cove shortly and so strike at the heart of
Nevada’s fortress!”</p>

<p>“Blazing torches of light!” cried John. “Let’s
not stay here gabbing. What can we do to help?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Stan grinned at the impetuous John.</p>

<p>It was fairly dark now and Stan was glad of the
small pocket flashlight he had. The boys could
best help by finding Holmes and his men and asking
for orders.</p>

<p>“We’ll find Holmes and get our orders!” he
said. “Let’s go!”</p>

<p>Since Holmes’ boat and one or more men were
likely to be in the cove where the <i>Staghound</i> now
lay at anchor, the boys slid along through the
bushes, cutting swiftly across paths, avoiding
known machine gun nests and tunnel entrances,
and so maneuvering for the dash down the path
to that cove. It took some time and the darkness
was alive with the noise of the fight! But they
made it safely and soon reached the shores of the
cove. There they found their rowboat where it
had been hidden, and hurried out to the sloop.
Some one challenged them as they drew up to the
sloop.</p>

<p>It proved to be a G-Man left aboard the sloop
to help protect it from intrusion by snoopers from
the island.</p>

<p>“What’s the row up there?” inquired the Federal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
agent tensely as the boys climbed aboard.</p>

<p>“Hegarty’s men are attacking to-night!”
cried Stan. “Where’s Mr. Holmes?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew!” said the man emphatically.
“It’s no joke—hello! Who’s there?”</p>

<p>The last part of his remark was addressed to the
darkness from which came the sounds of a boat’s
engine powerful and low!</p>

<p>“Agent Holmes!” came the reply in a clear
quiet voice. “Hegarty has pulled a fast one and
we’ve got to get reinforcements!”</p>

<p>“What about Dad?” demanded Stanley suddenly.
“You’re not leaving him alone in this
fight, are you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes grinned in the light of the cabin
lamps as he came down from the cockpit.</p>

<p>“Certainly not! Your father will be quite able
to take care of himself, unless I miscalculate his
ability, but I’m leaving two men up on the ridge
to watch for him and aid him if they can. In the
meantime—to Main Haven we go for more men!”</p>

<p>“Think we’ll be safe here in the cove till you
get back, Mr. Holmes?” queried Stanley.</p>

<p>The agent nodded, “I believe so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>He climbed back into the G-boat and it shortly
hummed out of the cove into the starlit night,
headed for Main Haven, and for the numerical
strength of the law to defeat the plans of the
underworld! Both Stanley and John thrilled as
they lost track of the white water about the racing
boat.</p>

<p>“They’ll be in Main Haven in no time!” Stan
said. “And I hope they get back twice as fast!
I’m nervous about Dad! Hegarty’s anxious to
get him!”</p>

<p>“Thumping blazes!” snapped John, snatching
up his bow and arrows. “What’s keeping us
here?”</p>

<p>Stan grinned and blew out the cabin light.</p>

<p>“Took the words right out of my mouth, John,”
said he. “Let’s go!”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, as they were coming up
over the highest rise and in sight of the battle, the
boys gave cries of astonishment! The entire ridge
of the cove was lined with darting flames of light,
and the apex of those flashes was a spot in the cove
in which the <i>Sea Hawk</i>, dimly outlined by her
own gunfire, was giving battle to Nevada! Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
other moving black shadows were sliding into the
cove now, spitting steel and fire! The <i>Malcon</i>
and the <i>Canton</i>, having discharged part of their
crews to surround the spot from the land, were
now coming to the aid of the embattled <i>Sea Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, at Main Haven, the racing
G-boat had summoned aid. Wires were humming
with the news. The Chief himself had dictated
crisp orders! Men were appearing instantly
as if from the ground itself. From barber shops,
boat yards, and the grocery store, came men who
had worked for a day or so now as common working
men but who were highly trained law officers
awaiting this very summons!</p>

<p>They came on the run, adjusting automatics in
holsters, unleashing hand machine guns, checking
the fuses on tear-gas bombs! Waiting boats
appeared as if from the water itself, trim, speedy
craft, with trained men ready to handle the helms!
From points along the coast other swift boats put
out, too, and, within a half hour, Porpoise Island
would not only be surrounded with wary and
swift boats waiting for escaping underworld craft,
but the beaches on the island would receive corps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
of G-men, each a crack shot, each capable of
effective single-handed combat, each determined
to capture the criminals alive or die wiping them
out!</p>

<p>They had taken Alvin Karpis, Baby-Face
Nelson, Dillinger in their stride, and a host of
other public enemies! They had trimmed the
sails of Hogan and Brennan! They loved the
law and the right and hated the rats who tried to
undermine and destroy the sacred common rights
of mankind! And they went up the hills of Porpoise
Island that night eager for combat, brave,
strong, resourceful!</p>

The Secret of Black Cove</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER leaving the boys that afternoon in the
capable hands of Butch, Gallagher had gone
back to Nevada to talk over certain plans in connection
with Hegarty’s expected attack. And
he had been so engaged when Marzonij had been
shown up. He had left the room wondering just
what it was Marzonij had brought in the way of
news and he had more than a hunch that it concerned
himself. He waited patiently with Dago
while the interview took place, and was doing
some fast thinking by the time Cowboy sent him
to the supply room. Cowboy had told him to
check the small arms supplies. They’d already
been checked twice by Dago, so Cowboy could
only be stalling him for time!</p>

<p>He went to the supply room and walked about
it trying to remember every detail of Marzonij’s
remarks while he was getting Cowboy to agree to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
a private interview, trying to guess Cowboy’s
thoughts after that interview by the look of
Nevada’s face, estimating his chances of having
been exposed as a law-man! But he could not
arrive at any certainty in his conclusions. He must
go on bluffing till he learned his bluff had been
called! It was his duty! And if Cowboy suspected
that the truth trapped him and elected to shoot
him down in cold blood, he’d take it like a man,
remembering that the F. B. I. expects the courage
of a soldier in its men!</p>

<p>It was getting dark outside by now, Mr. Sandborn
knew, and he knew that by this time two
nights hence Hegarty would try conclusions with
the notorious Nevada!</p>

<p>The first intimation that things had reached a
climax already was the flinging open of the store-room
door as some one entered from the cabin
tunnel. At the same time a man came into the
supply room from a side aisle. Both men were
tense and spoke in sharp, nervous voices.</p>

<p>“Hegarty’s here, Gallagher!” cried one.</p>

<p>“We’re in for some hot typewriting to-night,
Gallagher,” said the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>And at that moment, Dago himself appeared in
the doorway from the cabin. He was purple of
face as seen in the electric lights of the store-room.
He was gripping a submachine gun in his paws.</p>

<p>“Grab him, men!” cried Dago. “He’s a Fed!”</p>

<p>But the two men, who now stood, quite by accident
between Dago and Mr. Sandborn, were too
startled by what Dago yelled to do anything for
a full second. For all they knew it might be a big
joke on Dago’s part, though why Dago should
be kidding when Hegarty’s men were in full
attack, was beyond them!</p>

<p>By that time Mr. Sandborn, his own thinking
conditioned by training and habit, had darted like
a shadow down a side aisle and was streaking it
for the tunnel entrance near the aquarium before
Dago could get into real pursuit! Then came the
whine of steel as Mr. Sandborn covered the last
forty yards to the entrance! The slugs bit and
rang on the woodwork and metal of the entrance,
but the G-man was through and in the open in a
flash now!</p>

<p>His first concern was for the boys, and he raced
over a path, noting as he ran that the firing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
battle was coming from the land ridge on the west
of the cove! That would mean that Hegarty had
sent an overland party to draw attention from a
main attack elsewhere! The fleet-footed G-man
did not know that as he dashed down one path towards
the waiting room he passed within ten feet
of the hidden boys, who had been crawling forward
to find their arrows.</p>

<p>He reached the entrance to the waiting room
tunnel, fumbled for a second for the release catch,
then raced down the steps and the tunnel towards
the spot where the boys should still be in the company
of Butch! He entered the waiting room to
stumble headlong over the prostrate figure of
Butch! One glance at the man’s bonds told the
story, and the elated G-man raced back again
through the tunnel, disregarding the muffled
groans from the unfortunate Butch.</p>

<p>Now where would the boys be? Mr. Sandborn
did not know, but he’d have to look about for
them. He became now a silent shadow slinking
swiftly about from one spot of the field of action
to another, examining tunnel entrances, bushes,
the boat-house, and the launches for the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>Marzonij meanwhile had raced out of the
channel to meet the oncoming <i>Sea Hawk</i>. He had
been taken aboard, reported his trip to Hegarty,
and confirmed the fact of the beginning of the
Big Fight, then taken his place at a gun as the
big yacht moved into the channel to the cove. The
<i>Malcon</i> had come up the sea side, having dropped
her landing crew, and the <i>Canton</i> had come round
from the bay side around the snout.</p>

<p>The big yacht tore into the cove first, opening
fire as she came, and the others followed at short
distances behind.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn, trapped between the fires of
both the yachts and the machine gun crews on the
ridges, made haste to get out of his present position
as quickly as possible. As he did so he came
face to face with Dago. Dago had just come
round a flower bush in the dark, gun in hand, and
the men recognized each other at once. Dago’s
gun muzzle bore down as Mr. Sandborn’s right
hand brought up the automatic he carried. As
the G-man’s trigger finger squeezed, he contrived
to slip to his knees!</p>

<p>The blast of Dago’s submachine gun seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
almost to lift the G-man’s hat from his head, but
it was high and clear! Mr. Sandborn’s shot hit
the gangster in the fingers, and, yelling with pain,
Dago turned and bolted.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn gave chase, and Dago darted
along the cove trail towards a certain gun nest!
As the swarthy fellow tore along he suddenly
leaped off the ground with a scream of pain, and
fell in a sprawling, clawing heap! Mr. Sandborn
was upon him in an instant, clipping him
sharply on the head with the muzzle of his automatic.
The big mobster now senseless, the G-man
tied him securely with torn strips of clothing, and
left him gagged and helpless in the bushes. He’d
be found when needed, Mr. Sandborn suspected!</p>

<p>“Dad!” came a loud outcry of a youthful voice.</p>

<p>The G-man darted in the direction of the voice
and was standing in deep bushes grasping his
son with strong, glad hands a moment later.</p>

<p>“I’m sure glad you’re safe, son,” said he.</p>

<p>“How’d you like that shot, Mr. Sandborn?”
queried John. “Did you see Stan’s arrow sticking
in Dago’s pants?”</p>

<p>The truth was that the arrow had been dislodged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
by Dago’s sprawling fall, but the G-man
had no doubt that a steel-tipped hunting arrow
had caused Dago’s yowl of pain!</p>

<p>“It was a swell shot, boys,” agreed Mr. Sandborn.
“But you boys had better get back to the
beaches away from this dangerous scrap! Are
there any G-men ashore, do you know?”</p>

<p>Stan explained that Holmes had left lookouts
behind and gone for aid, and Mr. Sandborn then
said it was wise to get through the lines, if possible,
and be clear of the actual fight for a while at least.</p>

<p>But as the boys and the G-man emerged from
the bushes, they came face to face with Cowboy
Nevada himself! He was hurrying up the trail,
evidently bound on a visit to one of his machine
gun emplacements, and he was surprised to meet
Gallagher. Before he could say or do a thing,
the G-man had flung himself upon Nevada.</p>

<p>Nevada, an old hand at scrapping, shook off the
G-man, trying to maneuver for a shot or two
with his six-guns, but Mr. Sandborn whipped out
with alert hands and grabbed the wrists of the desperado!</p>

<p>He twisted hard as he did so, and the guns clattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to the ground out of reach, where Stanley
and John picked them up and hoved them away
from the fight. Grunting with the effort of his
blows, the trained G-man flung himself again
upon Nevada, intent on knocking out the Westerner
and taking him alive! Nevada swapped
punches for a moment or two, then turned and ran
for the cabin!</p>

<p>The suddenness of this retreat took the G-man
by surprise, and Nevada had a dozen paces head
start. But Mr. Sandborn was not to be left
behind, and he closed up, reached out his right
hand, and grabbed the fleeing gunman and crime
head by the shoulders, spilling him to the ground!
Then, as Nevada got up, Mr. Sandborn with perfect
timing ducked a punch and slapped home a
stiff uppercut that floored the head of the
country’s biggest crime corps for the count!</p>

<p>Expertly, Mr. Sandborn gagged and bound the
man as he had done with Dago, then he dragged
the unconscious man into deep shrubbery and left
him there.</p>

<p>At this time the situation at the cove took a turn
towards a climax as Hegarty put the <i>Sea Hawk</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
close to the boat-house and his men leaped ashore!
Nevada’s men came pouring down into the hollow
to intercept and fight the invaders, and Mr. Sandborn
and the boys had to duck into the bushes as
this took place.</p>

<p>“Our best bet, boys,” shouted Mr. Sandborn,
for the noise of gunfire drowned out ordinary talk,
“is to get up the ridge in case our men are coming
over. Holmes should be back by now with aid.”</p>

<p>The three of them dashed up the path to the
ridge, and, as they did so, they met the G-men
coming up the hill by every path, alert, able men
well armed, well trained, anxious to get in at close
quarters with the gangs!</p>

<p>“The Chief sent word for you to report to me,
Sandborn,” said Holmes, “and I’m to give you
orders!”</p>

<p>“All right, Holmes, let’s have your orders. I
am ready.”</p>

<p>Holmes grinned.</p>

<p>“You’ve done a swell job, Sandborn, and so
have the boys, unless my guess proves pretty
wrong when you spill the evidence in court, and
my orders are for you to go with the two boys to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
the <i>Staghound</i>, raise her sails, and head for
Centerport for another brief vacation!”</p>

<p>Protesting, Mr. Sandborn finally agreed to
those orders, but before he started down the slope
with the boys he left clear instructions as to where
Dago and Nevada could be found, and pointed
the directions of tunnel entrances. The agent in
charge shook hands with Mr. Sandborn and the
boys, and led his eager men in a long, circling line
down into the cove! It would not take those fine
young fighters long to tame the wild disordered
ranks of cheap gunmen and wipe out the last of
the biggest crime army yet to levy tribute on the
country’s business and people! And with the
capture or death of those men would go the
crumpling of the entire vast syndicate with its
network of pillage and spoilage! The F. B. I.
would add another splendid page to its excellent
record of arrests and convictions!</p>

<p>Down at the <i>Staghound</i> the boys and the tired
Mr. Sandborn enjoyed a cup of coffee and doughnuts
before raising the sails.</p>

<p>“Wow, what an adventure that was!” breathed
Stan. “And I’m glad it’s over, Dad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“No gladder than I am, and your mother will
be!” said the clear eyed man, smiling. “Let’s
stay home a few days and keep Mother company.
We’ve been nothing but worry to her for some
time now!”</p>

<p>“The water’s no place for pleasure lovers, I can
see,” laughed John. “Great gobs of whipped
cream—we’ll have to hike on the road next time,
or go camping, or build us a trailer and become
tin-can tourists! Maybe then we’ll just have a
good time and keep clear of gangsters and crime
syndicates!”</p>

<p>“Dad,” said Stan, breaking into John’s facetious
remarks, “both John and I are dying to know
what the wreck was at the bottom of Black Cove
and what it contained!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandborn helped himself to another doughnut
while John poured more coffee.</p>

<p>“The whole story is this, in a few words, boys,”
said he: “some years ago a rum-running yacht
called the <i>Shanghai</i>, owned and operated by
underworld interests, became a floating bank for
the deposit of the vast sums of money stolen by
that particular gang from dozens and scores of big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
bank robberies, and kidnapings! Besides that,
those mobsters added actual gold and silver bullion
stolen en route from mines to mints, and chests
of precious stones gathered by confidence men
and thieves from the necks and safes of rich
victims. Besides a normal cargo of liquor which
enabled the <i>Shanghai</i> to pose as an ordinary rum-runner,
she carried the immense loot I have
spoken of.</p>

<p>“For some months while the wealth was being
accumulated in that single hull, and while she rode
her place along notorious ‘Rum-Row,’ the secret
was safe; then some one talked, and in time Cowboy
Nevada, a small time racketeer, heard of it.</p>

<p>“He conceived and executed a clever plot by
means of which he took possession of the yacht on
the seas, took her into Black Cove, which he had
figured as a perfect spot for his plan, and sank
her at once during the same night, so that at daybreak
there was no trace of the vanished rum-runner!”</p>

<p>John choked on a doughnut, he was so surprised.</p>

<p>“That certainly was an ingenious way to set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
himself up in big-time racketeering!” said Stan.
“No wonder he had wealth to start him off on his
way to a syndicate!”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed Mr. Sandborn, soberly.
“And Nevada made sure to rescue, by a diver,
only what he really needed in ready riches to
handle his vast enterprises. He kept a pile of
cases loaded with currency in his store-room, but
the <i>Shanghai</i> must still contain a vast store of
jewels, money, and bullion. Most of it will
find its way shortly to its rightful owners!”</p>

<p>They finished the brief meal, and, warm and
somewhat rested, the boys hoisted sail, stowed the
tender on deck, and slacked off the sheets while
the fleet <i>Staghound</i>, which had been not so long
ago the black-hulled <i>Water Witch</i>, bore the G-man,
the G-man’s son, and the faithful and amusing
John Tallman towards the far lights of
Centerport, and home!</p>
